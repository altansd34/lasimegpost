The oldest Tour de&nbsp;France cycler Henri Paret was 50&nbsp;years old&nbsp;— back in&nbsp;1904, he&nbsp;finished the race in&nbsp;11th place. But there was someone who beat both records: both for longevity and cycling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f43/148/d2da77503d83cda8a3ae052f55.png><p>This is&nbsp;Gustaf Håkansson aka the Stålfarfar, which translates from Swedish to&nbsp;English as&nbsp;Steel Grandfather. By&nbsp;the way, I&nbsp;must confess I’m not Swedish. I&nbsp;know it’s hard to&nbsp;tell from my&nbsp;spot-on pronunciations, but&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, if&nbsp;not transparent. Let’s continue.</p><p>July 1951, <a href=# title=Sweden data-link=tag>Sweden</a>. The Annual Sverigeloppetcycling competition. By&nbsp;the way, this contest still exists, and the next one takes place in&nbsp;August 2023. Our man Gustaf, an&nbsp;ordinary bus driver from the Swedish town of&nbsp;Helsingborg decided to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cycling contest called Sverigeloppet, which intended a&nbsp;distance from Haparanda to&nbsp;Ystad. Haparanda in&nbsp;the very north of&nbsp;Sweden, very close to&nbsp;the Finnish border&nbsp;— and its residents speak both Swedish and Finnish.</p><p>And here’s Ystad in&nbsp;the very south of&nbsp;Sweden. You see it&nbsp;now? The bicycle tour lies throughout the whole country. The distance between these two towns is&nbsp;about 1,010 miles according to&nbsp;Google Maps. Sounds crazy for a&nbsp;bike ride!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b13/873/efaca25843908a0287f625aff3.png><p>But there’s more about the story. Gustaf wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the contest. He&nbsp;was 66&nbsp;in&nbsp;1951, and the maximum age for the participants was 40&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;was told he&nbsp;was too old to&nbsp;compete in&nbsp;the race and, therefore, his application was declined.</p><p>Little did he&nbsp;care about all those formalities and what the organizers said... Instead of&nbsp;accepting the refusal, Gustaf simply started the race shortly after the last ‘official’ participant set off. Formally, he&nbsp;wasn’t among those athletes.</p><p>Also, all of&nbsp;them had a&nbsp;shirt with a&nbsp;number tag, which Gustaf didn’t have initially, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the contest. It&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;big deal for the Steel Grandpa&nbsp;— he&nbsp;wrote himself a&nbsp;big zero on&nbsp;his bib assigning this number tag himself. He&nbsp;probably made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;show everyone he&nbsp;was serious about his intentions to&nbsp;participate&nbsp;— and in&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;stand out, he&nbsp;wore a&nbsp;makeshift uniform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/665/4ce/de4dbd5827bd845c79c96c3045.png><p>One more reason why the organizers didn’t quite fancy the idea of&nbsp;Gustaf’s participation was his looks. Thing&nbsp;is, he&nbsp;sported a&nbsp;long white beard which made him look even older than he&nbsp;was. The beard was so&nbsp;long that it&nbsp;almost fully covered his participant number tag. There were 50&nbsp;other participants, all of&nbsp;them half his age.</p><p>Plus, those guys had equipment more adapted for a&nbsp;competition like that. Gustaf, instead, didn’t really have any professional gear&nbsp;— all he&nbsp;had was his roadster with mudguards, headlamp, and, surprisingly, panniers. Gustaf’s bike was quite different from what the other cyclers had.</p><p>The average cycling speed of&nbsp;an&nbsp;intermediate cycler is&nbsp;around 12&nbsp;to&nbsp;16&nbsp;miles per hour. Let’s say it’s 15&nbsp;miles per hour. To&nbsp;cover the distance between Haparanda and Ystad such a&nbsp;cycler would need a&nbsp;whopping 67&nbsp;hours or&nbsp;almost 3&nbsp;days, and I’m not counting either sleep or&nbsp;meal time here. But that’s just theory: no&nbsp;one can ride a&nbsp;bike for 3&nbsp;days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row without stopping.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0a6/f80/ba62005fd8b16f516e87301177.png><p>It&nbsp;took Gustaf 6&nbsp;days, 14&nbsp;hours, and 20&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;cover this distance. We&nbsp;don’t know at&nbsp;what speed he&nbsp;pedaled, but we&nbsp;know for sure that not only did he&nbsp;manage to&nbsp;make&nbsp;it, but he&nbsp;even crossed the finish line 24&nbsp;hours before any other contestant did. While all the other participants had breaks and slept, the Steel Grandpa would continue pedaling for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;three days in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row almost without sleeping.</p><p>I&nbsp;guess stamina is&nbsp;not about age, but about determination, huh? However, some people might even say Gustaf cheated. Thing&nbsp;is, all the official racers were forced to&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;— it&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the basic rules during the competition. There were special checkpoints where the racers would meet at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the day to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;break and to&nbsp;sleep. In&nbsp;the morning, fresh and full of&nbsp;energy, they could continue pedaling.</p><p>But as&nbsp;the Steel Grandpa wasn’t officially a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the race, he&nbsp;could easily neglect that rule and avoid those checkpoints, which he&nbsp;did. Initially, there was a&nbsp;gap between Gustaf and the rest of&nbsp;the pack, but the checkpoint trick helped him leave all the other racers behind. So, while the official participants were chilling at&nbsp;the checkpoint, Gustaf only took an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;rest, and as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;his tiny break was over, he&nbsp;set off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/149/624/bc66335cea9fd6567808bae8d1.png><p>Soon after the contest started, the Steel Grandpa’s efforts went public. No&nbsp;one could believe an&nbsp;old and fragile man could be&nbsp;doing all that. Some people were worried whether he&nbsp;would stay alive. Gustaf’s pace was surprisingly good, and people were wondering how long he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it.</p><p>One day passed, two days passed, but Gustaf wasn’t likely to&nbsp;give&nbsp;up. He&nbsp;pedaled all his might as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;didn’t care at&nbsp;all about all the basic needs a&nbsp;human being has. They say he&nbsp;only slept for 5&nbsp;hours in&nbsp;3&nbsp;days. At&nbsp;some point, in&nbsp;Söderhamn, the police tried to&nbsp;convince him to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;actual break and even a&nbsp;medical examination.</p><p>As&nbsp;you might have guessed, the medical exam proved Gustaf was in&nbsp;good health, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;continued pedaling. All the rivals were far behind the Steel Grandpa, and it&nbsp;seemed like there was nothing in&nbsp;this world that could prevent him from winning the race. There were only about 800 yards left to&nbsp;the finishing line when something unforeseen happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6c1/bf2/2589395adf92cfbfc2fdee232f.png><p>We&nbsp;already know Gustaf didn’t have any professional gear&nbsp;— all he&nbsp;had was his bike. It&nbsp;served him perfectly well but all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, when there was only half a&nbsp;mile to&nbsp;go, the bike got a&nbsp;flat tire. You might think it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;big problem, but Gustaf was unperturbed. He&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;finish the race even with a&nbsp;flat tire.</p><p>It&nbsp;was another trick though: to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on, he&nbsp;dismounted the bike. Just a&nbsp;few yards left. Gustaf could already see the finish. He&nbsp;mounted his bike again to&nbsp;cross the finish line. He&nbsp;was 24&nbsp;hours ahead of&nbsp;all the other participants. Even though his victory was unofficial, it&nbsp;caused a&nbsp;wide public response.</p><p>Gustaf got so&nbsp;famous he&nbsp;was even invited to&nbsp;an&nbsp;audience with king Gustaf VI&nbsp;Adolf of&nbsp;Sweden. The fun part of&nbsp;that story is&nbsp;that Gustaf was allegedly most happy not because he&nbsp;won the race and even met the King of&nbsp;Sweden, but because he&nbsp;proved the doctors wrong who believed he&nbsp;was too old to&nbsp;compete in&nbsp;the race.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d37/cd4/47a10f540a8352f050d41f5b76.png><p>In&nbsp;reality, the Steel Grandpa covered way more than 1,000&nbsp;miles. You already know he&nbsp;was from the town of&nbsp;Helsingborg, and the race started in&nbsp;Haparanda. We&nbsp;gotta take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the map again. Here’s Helsingborg, and it’s in&nbsp;the south. Haparanda is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the very north. Right, that would have been much more convenient if&nbsp;the race had started and not finished in&nbsp;Ystad.</p><p>So, according to&nbsp;Google Maps, he&nbsp;actually rode way more than 1,000 miles&nbsp;— first, he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the starting point and only then he&nbsp;could take part in&nbsp;the contest. At&nbsp;least it&nbsp;didn’t take him much time to&nbsp;come back home once he&nbsp;finished the race!</p><p>This wasn’t his only race. In&nbsp;1927, when he&nbsp;was 42&nbsp;he conquered the northern Swedish mountains by&nbsp;bike. He&nbsp;also reportedly rode to&nbsp;Jerusalem back in&nbsp;1959 when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;his seventies. He&nbsp;also broke another record being the oldest recording artist at&nbsp;the time&nbsp;— yep, he&nbsp;did record some songs. Also, he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;some ads.</p><p>One more record here&nbsp;— as&nbsp;you already know, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;centenarian and lived for 101&nbsp;years. However, this record was broken by&nbsp;his wife Maria, who lived for 105&nbsp;years. Today, there’s even a&nbsp;permanent exhibition called Stålfarfar in&nbsp;Johannamuseet, Skurup. Now, who’s too old to&nbsp;compete? You know, I&nbsp;could use some Swedish meatballs right about now...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMC1scSlZKCqkaOxsa2MsJ%2BoZaeku27Ax55kraelnLWmv9NmmaKjlWK%2Foq%2FEZm9qbWZnhnA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./entertainment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taron Egerton popularity &amp;amp; fame">&larr;
