Tate has also faced sexual abuse accusations, and is <a href=#>currently under house arrest in Romania</a> while being investigated on charges of human trafficking and potentially rape.</p><p data-block-key=4rf5b>Tate’s apparent popularity among young boys on social media platforms like TikTok has <a href=#>led to concerns that children are being taught toxic masculinity and misogynistic views of women</a>.</p><p data-block-key=35s05>But what is his influence among adults? Our new study looks at Britons’ awareness and approval of Andrew Tate, how many people agree with his views (particularly on women), and what they consider his views on women to be.</p><h2 data-block-key=o2iuy>How many Britons know, and like, Andrew Tate?</h2><p data-block-key=1xlk3>Overall, 63% of Britons appear to be familiar with Andrew Tate. This includes 49% with a negative view (including 44% with a “very” unfavourable view), while just 6% have a positive opinion of the social media influencer. Another 8% have heard of Tate, but haven’t formed a view on him.</p><p data-block-key=czdr5>Men, and young men in particular, are the most likely to have a favourable view of Tate. While 12% of all men hold a positive opinion, this rises to 27% of 18-29 year old men. This compares to just 3% of all women and 5% of 18-29 year old women.</p><h2 data-block-key=oh7o1>How many Britons agree with Andrew Tate, in general?</h2><p data-block-key=0528r>Unsurprisingly, given the ratio of favourable to unfavourable opinions of Tate, the large majority of those who have heard of him say they disagree with ‘the sort of things that he says’ – 69%, including 59% who “strongly” disagree. Only 14% say they agree with him generally, including just 4% who do so strongly. (Calculating these results as a percentage of the entire population – whether they have heard of Tate or not – gives a figure equivalent to 9% of all Britons agreeing with Andrew Tate).</p><p data-block-key=hi32l>Again, it is men who have heard of Tate (21%) and young men especially (38% of 18-29 year old men, and 37% of 30-39 year old men) who are most likely to agree with him – although in each case more generally disagree (50-64%).</p><h2 data-block-key=yt5g9>How many Britons agree with Andrew Tate, about women?</h2><p data-block-key=lfblt>Among those who have heard of Tate, 10% say they agree with his views on women, including 15% of men and 26% of 18-29 year old men. Only 4% of women and 7% of 18-29 year old women say the same.</p><p data-block-key=wmync>(Recalculating the figures to show them as a percentage of the entire population – not just those who have heard of Tate – means the results represent 6% of all Britons saying they agree with Tate’s views on women, including 10% of men and 24% of 18-29 year old men).</p><p data-block-key=q3z8q>Among Britons with a favourable view of Tate, 78% say the agree with the things he says about work and success, 64% when it comes to masculinity and being a man, and 54% for how women should be treated. One in three of those with a favourable view of Tate (34%) say they disagree with his opinions regarding women.</p><p data-block-key=5wtoz>That there is such a significant gap between the number of men who appreciate Tate’s words on success compared to his views on women suggests that at least part of his fanbase are following him for the philosophy behind e.g. Hustlers University, rather than for his views on the opposite sex.</p><h2 data-block-key=oaalo>What do Andrew Tate fans and opponents think his views on women actually are?</h2><p data-block-key=9pxjt>But are those who say they agree with Tate on women engaging with the same things he says about women as those who disagree with him? Tate’s remarks about women range from the traditional belief that <a href=#>it is a husband's duty to protect and provide for his wife</a> to suggesting that <a href=#>it can be women’s fault if they are raped</a> – but is that equally acknowledged by both sides?</p><p data-block-key=0rlbw>The answer appears to be no, with results showing that many in the two groups are hearing different things from or about Andrew Tate.</p><p data-block-key=p0zpd>The statement that those who say they disagree with Tate’s views on women are <i>most</i> likely to say he believes is also the one that Tate fans are the <i>least</i> likely to think he believes: “that it can be the woman's fault if she is raped or sexually assaulted”. While 34% of those who agree with Tate on women think this is a fair representation of his beliefs, 47% of those who disagree with his views say the same.</p><p data-block-key=t8zlc>Similar numbers of Tate-disagree-ers also consider “that a wife is her husband's property” (46%), “that it is wrong for women to have had lots of sexual partners” (45%), “that in a heterosexual relationship the man should work and the woman should stay in the home” (41%), and “it is a husband's duty to protect and provide for his wife” (43%) to be accurate representations of his views.</p><p data-block-key=bsjfw>Among those who say they agree with Tate’s views on women, this latter point is joint-top for what they are most likely to think sounds Tate-esque, with 56% saying they believe he thinks it is a man’s duty to look protect and provide for his wife. As many also think he believes that it is wrong for women to have lots of sexual partners (56%) and ‘women and children first’ on a sinking ship (54%).</p><p data-block-key=umezw>Another noticeable difference between Tate agree-ers and disagree-ers is that the latter are more likely to answer “don’t know” when asked what they think his views of women are: only 10-16% of those who agree with Andrew Tate on women compared to 16-42% for those who disagree.</p><p data-block-key=m0wwz>This difference in familiarity is not surprising – people are not likely to invest much time into watching content by someone they dislike, particularly if their first exposure to that person is through media articles highlighting the views they disagree with.</p><p data-block-key=wco7w>Overall, approximately 2-3% of Britons agree with Andrew Tate’s on women AND think any of the cited beliefs represent his own views. Among men in general this is 4-6% and is 7-14% among 18-29 year old men.</p><p data-block-key=blsxh><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=zpckq><i>Photo: @cobratate</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZWyAdnnHqK5mpZGjxm6u0aKrqKajYq6ovsSeZJqmlKeyuHnTmqueq12rtqbD0mauqKWVow%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-people-speak-english.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many people speak English and where is it spoken?">&larr;
