When put under a&nbsp;great amount of&nbsp;pressure, the stitches on&nbsp;the loop rip apart so&nbsp;the excess fabric can assist in&nbsp;cushioning the passengers. The extra few inches can make a&nbsp;great difference within a&nbsp;dire circumstance. However, there isn’t one on&nbsp;the driver’s side. As&nbsp;the driver is&nbsp;so&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the steering wheel, it’s safer for them not to&nbsp;have one. Seat belts were originally invented in&nbsp;the mid-19th century, though this <a href=# title=technology data-link=tag>technology</a> wasn’t brought into common practice until the <strong>1960s</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/559/f4c/ee625b53b9a92e836c883c4fdb.jpeg><p>Pre-collision sensory technology has assisted with developing the safety of&nbsp;seat belts and other features to&nbsp;the next level. Effectively predicting a&nbsp;car’s collision, the technology directs the seat belts to&nbsp;automatically tighten, aligning the airbags and ensuring the brakes will be&nbsp;preloaded to&nbsp;reduce shock. Every year, <strong>6&nbsp;million car accidents</strong> occur, which explains why all cars still must continue to&nbsp;develop safety features, not only to&nbsp;alleviate accidents but to&nbsp;protect people more effectively within their cars. The materials that make up&nbsp;the body of&nbsp;cars only started getting replaced within the last 25&nbsp;years, ranging from aluminum and magnesium alloys to&nbsp;carbon fiber composites. These lighter materials not only enable a&nbsp;more fuel-efficient journey, but they also ensure that when a&nbsp;car is&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident, its build provides a ’crumple zone’. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;car hits another object, the crumple zone absorbs energy from the collision. Although this would appear to&nbsp;cause more damage to&nbsp;the car, it&nbsp;helps prevent impact on&nbsp;the passengers.</p><p>Front and rear bumpers are very underrated, and due to&nbsp;their long <a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> of&nbsp;being used in&nbsp;cars, you cant imagine a&nbsp;time we&nbsp;didn’t use them. They were invented <strong>in&nbsp;the late 1800s</strong>. The bumpers evolved over the years to&nbsp;the point we&nbsp;don’t even realize we&nbsp;have them. But they are there, quietly waiting under the outer covers, consisting of&nbsp;compressible foam or&nbsp;<a href=# title=plastic data-link=tag>plastic</a> around a&nbsp;rigid reinforced bar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/aa2/7e3/491c315df4963f9288776b3bd2.jpeg><p>All the windows of&nbsp;your car are made of&nbsp;glass, but the windshield is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shatterproof version. It’s laminated, so&nbsp;whatever might hit&nbsp;it, you can be&nbsp;sure there won’t be&nbsp;any shards of&nbsp;glass falling into the front seats. Normal glass was used up&nbsp;until the 1950s.</p><p>As&nbsp;vehicles became more prominent, they made modifications to&nbsp;ensure safety. Airbags seem like another common feature that has always been there. In&nbsp;fact, they were originally invented in&nbsp;<strong>1968</strong> and were ahead of&nbsp;their time. They slowly gained popularity, and through safety precautions for cars, they eventually became mandatory for all cars to&nbsp;have only in&nbsp;<strong>1998</strong>. They have since developed from just being an&nbsp;airbag within the steering wheel. Today, depending on&nbsp;the vehicle, they can be&nbsp;located throughout the car, ensuring all potential passengers will be&nbsp;protected. Crash sensors connected to&nbsp;an&nbsp;onboard computer detect when a&nbsp;collision occurs and trigger the bags, inflating within milliseconds, and providing a&nbsp;cushioned safety within a&nbsp;blink of&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye.</p><p>It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;predict the <a href=# title=weather data-link=tag>weather</a> and even more so&nbsp;to&nbsp;determine traction on&nbsp;the road. In&nbsp;the late 1960s, anti-lock braking systems were implemented in&nbsp;vehicles. Before that, they had been used in&nbsp;many aircraft, with designs going as&nbsp;far back as&nbsp;1908. They soon became a&nbsp;necessity for all vehicles, ensuring traction is&nbsp;maintained on&nbsp;slippery surfaces and that there is&nbsp;complete control when braking. Today, <a href=# title=ABS data-link=tag>ABS</a> has advanced so&nbsp;much that the latest variations ensure further detection when there are strong crosswinds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/dfd/be0/075cb05173851f528777551170.jpeg><p>Cruise control, initially invented in&nbsp;<strong>1948</strong>, has been in&nbsp;constant development over many decades. Today, ’adaptive cruise control’ ensures that when the car is&nbsp;cruising at&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant speed and detects a&nbsp;slower car ahead, it&nbsp;will then adjust the speed to&nbsp;match the car in&nbsp;front. Other advanced variants may also ensure the car will make a&nbsp;complete stop once identifying that the car in&nbsp;front has done the same. It’s easy to&nbsp;forget to&nbsp;have your high beams on&nbsp;when driving on&nbsp;the long and lonesome road for many hours.</p><p>Automatic high beams are quickly becoming more common. High-tech camera modules can easily determine what type of&nbsp;light is&nbsp;passing through and help ensure when the high beam will be&nbsp;necessary. Although versions of&nbsp;automatic high beams have been around since the 1950s, they counted on&nbsp;light-sensitive sensors and were very unreliable. The new varieties can identify the sources of&nbsp;light, whether it’s from the sun, directly from a&nbsp;car’s light, or&nbsp;even from the reflection on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign, ensuring you won’t cause issues with other drivers. It’s a&nbsp;pain in&nbsp;the neck to&nbsp;have to&nbsp;ensure there isn’t anyone creeping into that semi-visible corner, the <strong>blind spot</strong>, which causes around 400,000 accidents per year. Solar sensors within rear bumpers of&nbsp;vehicles, and blind-spot monitoring systems, watch and identify adjacent lanes. They alert the driver that a&nbsp;vehicle may be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the lane beside them, whether by&nbsp;flashing lights on&nbsp;the dash or&nbsp;from beeping sounds. This way, they help to&nbsp;alleviate the many concerns the blind spot causes</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/543/7b1/99eb1a5143af6f54a0172843e9.jpeg><p><strong>1.6 million road accidents</strong> are caused by&nbsp;texting and driving, and fatigue normally causes up&nbsp;to&nbsp;10% of&nbsp;all car accidents per year. The <strong>Driver-Attention Monitor</strong> helps to&nbsp;alleviate both statistics. It&nbsp;works through sensors that monitor the car’s movements and the amount of&nbsp;steering corrections to&nbsp;ensure the driver is&nbsp;paying attention to&nbsp;the road. When the system identifies that the driver isn’t completely awake or&nbsp;is&nbsp;slightly distracted with their phone, it&nbsp;will prompt signals to&nbsp;suggest its time for a&nbsp;break.</p><p>Tires are among the most critical components for your car, with a&nbsp;close relationship with whatever path you take. Many safety features rely on&nbsp;the tires themselves for their own independent purposes. That’s why it’s super important to&nbsp;ensure the tires are always in&nbsp;top condition. <strong>Tire pressure</strong> monitoring systems check the air pressure of&nbsp;all four tires, ensuring you’re aware when they need their pressure increased to&nbsp;avoid the risk of&nbsp;a&nbsp;blowout. The constant evolution in&nbsp;technologies continues to&nbsp;ensure you stay safe on&nbsp;longer stretches of&nbsp;the road. Lane departure warnings focus on&nbsp;the lines on&nbsp;the road, ensuring the car stays within. Whenever a&nbsp;car starts drifting over a&nbsp;line in&nbsp;the road without signaling to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, the camera-based feature identifies and signals to&nbsp;the driver. The lane-keeping assist feature follows the same method of&nbsp;identifying when the car is&nbsp;intruding the bordering lane. When it&nbsp;gets too close, it&nbsp;will readjust the steering and center the car within its appropriate lane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e47/48e/273b61563ea3caa3df114f3594.jpeg><p>Other features in&nbsp;more advanced cars have autonomous driving capabilities. The autopilot systems have taken cruise control to&nbsp;the next level. Not only does it&nbsp;allow the vehicle to&nbsp;steer itself in&nbsp;the intended lane while maintaining a&nbsp;set speed, but it&nbsp;also changes lanes when required, making the ride more and more efficient. Some safety features are only just making a&nbsp;trend in&nbsp;car models worldwide. For example, night vision using thermographic cameras to&nbsp;look out for pedestrians and animals nearby. It&nbsp;goes within the infotainment screen, facing frontwards and identifying objects from their heat signatures.</p><p>It’s estimated that there are <strong>over 1.4 billion</strong> cars in&nbsp;use worldwide, and as&nbsp;the world’s population increases, it’s expected that the number of&nbsp;cars will follow suit. Safety features will continue to&nbsp;adapt further beyond what we&nbsp;know of&nbsp;today. Infra-red headlights will be&nbsp;further adapted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;conditions with poor visibility like storms, snow, and fog. They will be&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;enhancing the visibility of&nbsp;the driver in&nbsp;all conditions without affecting the sight of&nbsp;passing drivers. Driver override systems will soon be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;monitor and identify human behavior. Whether due to&nbsp;reckless conduct on&nbsp;the road or&nbsp;for other safety precautions, cars will soon have the functionality to&nbsp;take complete control of&nbsp;themselves, ensuring both the passengers’ and the driver’s safety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/559/ccc/c1185757d29229bab41e3dee22.jpeg><p>Augmented reality windshields are in&nbsp;early development already, providing some indicator reflections from the dash onto the windshield. So&nbsp;it’s quite possible that soon all necessary directions from maps and alerts will appear right in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the driver to&nbsp;ensure they never take their eyes off the road. Airbags will soon not only just be&nbsp;used within a&nbsp;car to&nbsp;ensure the passengers’ safety. They will also activate from the outside of&nbsp;the car once they identify a&nbsp;definitive collision. The airbags will inflate outwards, covering the entire outside of&nbsp;the car, and drastically reducing its impact. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;so&nbsp;advanced that the bodywork of&nbsp;the car won’t even need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;buffed out! The future technology of&nbsp;cars is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;progressive that the cars themselves will have their own form of&nbsp;communication, not with human drivers, but with other cars. Just imagine: cars communicating and sharing information as&nbsp;they identify roadblocks, issues on&nbsp;the road, or&nbsp;disruptive weather patterns. It&nbsp;will all ensure the most efficient and safest route possible.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCmr9Geq2akn6S9brvNZphmq5WWwW6uxKWrZpmemXqwwMeeqWabkad6qbXDnZynZZaarrXB0Z6qZnBhaoZ5gY4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ted-cruz-eligibility-questions-sinking-in.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ted Cruz Eligibility Questions Sinking In With Voters">&larr;
