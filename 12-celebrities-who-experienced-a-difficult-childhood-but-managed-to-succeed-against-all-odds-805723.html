However, in&nbsp;many cases, that is&nbsp;far from true. There are quite a&nbsp;few superstars out there whose childhoods resemble the scenes of&nbsp;horror movies. Luckily, all of&nbsp;them were strong and fortunate enough to&nbsp;overcome the challenges they were exposed to&nbsp;at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are always inspired by&nbsp;people who push forward no&nbsp;matter the circumstances and whose determination can make anyone feel more optimistic.</p><p><h2>1. Hilary Swank</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/299/194/03f6135222a184e288252b1f81.jpg><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talking</a> about her childhood, the Oscar-winning actress said that she grew up&nbsp;<a href=# title=poor data-link=tag>poor</a>, and because of&nbsp;that, the parents of&nbsp;her peers wouldn’t let their children play with her. Hilary’s older <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>brother</a> left the family home early in&nbsp;his teens, and the actress’s parents separated when she was 16. Her mother was supportive of&nbsp;her acting career, so&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them moved to&nbsp;California, but <strong>couldn’t afford an&nbsp;apartment.</strong></p><p>Hilary ended up&nbsp;living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;trailer park while she attended acting lessons. Remembering her high <a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a> years, Hilary <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>: "<strong>I&nbsp;felt like such an&nbsp;outsider</strong>. I&nbsp;didn’t feel like&nbsp;I fit&nbsp;in. I&nbsp;didn’t belong in&nbsp;any way. I&nbsp;didn’t even feel like the teachers wanted me&nbsp;there. I&nbsp;just felt like&nbsp;I wasn’t seen or&nbsp;understood.’’</p><p><h2>2. Ashley Judd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c68/eab/9084835732b314d7afa952a6cf.jpg><p>The gorgeous actress described the hardships she went through as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>book</a> <i>All That Is&nbsp;Bitter and Sweet</i>. When Ashley was a&nbsp;child, her mother financially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> to&nbsp;raise her and her sister before she started a&nbsp;career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer.</p><p>Financial troubles forced the family to&nbsp;occasionally live <strong>without electricity or&nbsp;indoor plumbing</strong>. When her mother would go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tour, Ashely <strong>was left alone for long periods</strong>. The actress’s childhood traumas led her to&nbsp;develop <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a> later in&nbsp;life. However, Judd has been able to&nbsp;overcome challenges by&nbsp;undergoing therapy.</p><p><h2>3. Oprah Winfrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/140/0f7/8c8b9857af9ca21a12b671d691.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>’s mother was only 18&nbsp;when she had her. The famous talk show host grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;such poverty that she was often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>forced</a> to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;<strong>potato sack</strong> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dress when she was a&nbsp;child. Living in&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely dangerous and poor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>neighborhood</a>, she was forced to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;much earlier than her peers.</p><p><a href=# title=Oprah data-link=tag>Oprah</a> gave birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;son when she was just 14&nbsp;years old, but the <strong>baby died</strong> soon afterward. She was forced to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>job</a> while she was still in&nbsp;high school, which led her to&nbsp;the position of&nbsp;a&nbsp;radio show host and from there, her career took off.</p><p><h2>4. Jim Carrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f01/542/fa69ca5842a5fbc7735c37b5a5.jpg><p>The legendary comedian grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>crowded household</strong> with 4&nbsp;other siblings and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;financial difficulties. His family was so&nbsp;poor at&nbsp;one point that young Jim had <strong>to&nbsp;drop out </strong>of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>school</a>. When his father, who worked as&nbsp;an&nbsp;accountant, lost his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>job</a>, the family was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>homeless</a> for a&nbsp;while and was forced <strong>to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;van</strong>. The actor once said that it&nbsp;was during those difficult times that he&nbsp;developed a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>humor</a> and decided to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;career.</p><p><h2>5. Halle Berry</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f60/cf3/d49fcb58ab95a1eb79429c3f2f.jpg><p>This successful actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that she grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;troubled household</strong>: ’’I wasn’t married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;man that beat me&nbsp;up, but my&nbsp;mother was.’’ Young Halle was forced to&nbsp;witness beatings “day after day after day.” Her father <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>left</a> the family when Halle was only 4&nbsp;years old and they’ve remained estranged all her life.</p><p>She moved with her mother and sister to&nbsp;an&nbsp;all-white neighborhood where she was exposed to<strong>&nbsp;racial discrimination</strong> while attending <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>school</a>. Halle admits that these struggles motivated her to&nbsp;succeed. Later in&nbsp;the ’90s, when she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moved</a> to&nbsp;New York to&nbsp;pursue her acting career, she was forced to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>homeless shelter</strong> for a&nbsp;while because she couldn’t afford accommodations.</p><p><h2>6. Charlize Theron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/97a/5f4/d0be475eaf8820b6a8720cf61a.jpg><p>Theron spent her early <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>childhood</a> years living with her parents on&nbsp;an&nbsp;idyllic farm in&nbsp;South Africa, but her home life was troubled due to&nbsp;her father’s<strong> short temper</strong> and alcoholism. When she was&nbsp;15, the famous actress <strong>witnessed a&nbsp;traumatic incident</strong> in&nbsp;which her mother fatally wounded her father.</p><p>Young Charlize <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> for many years to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with it&nbsp;and for a&nbsp;long time she “pretended that it&nbsp;didn’t happen.” Fortunately, she was able to&nbsp;recover from her trauma by&nbsp;going into <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>therapy</a>.</p><p><h2>7. Mark Wahlberg</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ed/6a8/1cbace51efa3ef33e3c56273b3.jpg><p>Wahlberg grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;working-class <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a> as&nbsp;the <strong>youngest of&nbsp;9&nbsp;children</strong>. His parents divorced when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child and, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;14, he&nbsp;dropped out of&nbsp;high school. Before becoming famous, Wahlberg led a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>troubled</a> life, engaging in&nbsp;<strong>violence, stealing, and substance abuse</strong>. Luckily, he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;get back on&nbsp;track and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now happily married and has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4&nbsp;</a>children. Aside from acting, he&nbsp;devotes his time to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>charity</a> work.</p><p><h2>8. Naomi Watts</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5b/93a/e7e43a5bef956f448f51e938af.jpg><p>Watts is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a> of&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and a&nbsp;road manager for the British rock band Pink Floyd. Her parents divorced when she was 4&nbsp;years old, and <strong>her father tragically died</strong> when she was&nbsp;7, just before her parents wanted to&nbsp;give her a&nbsp;second chance to&nbsp;their marriage.</p><p>“<strong>When he&nbsp;died, my&nbsp;dad hadn’t saved money, and&nbsp;I guess my&nbsp;mom didn’t have any</strong>. So&nbsp;they, the band, gave my&nbsp;mom a&nbsp;few thousand dollars to&nbsp;help get things underway,” Watts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers</a>. After that, her family led a&nbsp;<strong>nomadic life</strong> in&nbsp;England, forcing Naomi to&nbsp;change <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>schools</a> 9&nbsp;different times. This lifestyle lasted several years before the family moved to&nbsp;Australia when Naomi was 14&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>9. Christina Aguilera</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b94/c04/bdec775e9f8ed30439ced4e8cc.jpg><p>Aguilera’s early <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>childhood</a> was troubled. Her father, a&nbsp;sergeant in&nbsp;the U.S. Army, was often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aggressive</a>, especially with her mother. Due to&nbsp;her father’s job, the family had to&nbsp;<strong>relocate frequently</strong>. It&nbsp;wasn’t until the famous singer turned 6&nbsp;that <strong>her mother managed to&nbsp;escape</strong> and move with her 2&nbsp;daughters, Christina and her younger sister, Rachel, and build a&nbsp;new life in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different city. Christina claims that she used <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>music</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>escape</a> from her troubled home life.</p><p><h2>10. Dylan McDermott</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b5c/a2a/bcaf3650e0a6f1d0685aec3c44.jpg><p>American <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> Dylan McDermott and his younger sister were raised by<strong>&nbsp;teenage parents</strong>, Diane and Richard. His mother was 15&nbsp;and his father was 17&nbsp;when McDermott was born. A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years later, after his parents <strong>divorced</strong>, Diane and her 2&nbsp;kids moved back in&nbsp;with Diane’s mother.</p><p>But soon afterward, things took an&nbsp;unfortunate turn. Dylan was 5&nbsp;and his sister was only 7&nbsp;months old when their mother<strong> tragically died in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shooting,</strong> and the circumstances surrounding this incident would remain a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mystery</a> for decades.</p><p><h2>11. Drew Barrymore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4d/347/838f3150079ad2c5f8a661e95d.jpg><p>Despite being the daughter of&nbsp;famous parents and growing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the spotlight, Drew Barrymore’s childhood was not as&nbsp;happy as&nbsp;we&nbsp;might imagine. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child star, she was exposed to&nbsp;the public’s attention, but was lacking closeness with her parents: “<strong>I&nbsp;didn’t really have parents, you know?</strong>” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>From the age of&nbsp;8, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> herself a&nbsp;“party girl,” partying with her mother and her friends almost every day. When she was only 14&nbsp;years old, she was sent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>rehabilitation facility</strong> for substance abuse and started living <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>independently</a> of&nbsp;her parents.</p><p><h2>12. Eminem</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86f/047/2dc28651e195e148fc5be52234.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</a>, aka Eminem, had a&nbsp;<strong>rough childhood</strong>, marked by&nbsp;poverty and aggression. The famous rapper claims his father <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>abandoned</a> him when he&nbsp;was only 6&nbsp;months old. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;14, he&nbsp;began rapping in&nbsp;clubs in&nbsp;Detroit, Michigan. He&nbsp;was bullied in&nbsp;school and, when unexcused absences held him back in&nbsp;the ninth grade for the third year, he&nbsp;quit school, determined to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> industry.</p><p>To&nbsp;what extent do&nbsp;you think our childhood determines what we&nbsp;become when we&nbsp;grow&nbsp;up?
