The man spoke from the stage and said many warm words about his wife, but the most romantic was his declaration of love from the scene:</p>“Thank you, Erica, for putting up with me. I’m very temperamental, and I love you very much…”<p class=align-left>On the red carpet, Erica Schmidt and Peter Dinklage held each other’s hands and looked in love even after fourteen years of being together. However, Peter also mentioned, that he had forgotten to thank his wife at the Emmy Awards Ceremony in 2015, but it seems that Erica totally forgave him.</p><p class=align-left>Today Peter Dinklage wife, Erica Schmidt is a mother for two children. They welcomed the first child in 2011, and today the girl is already five years old. The pregnancy with the second child was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">kept in secret</a>, but it was noticed that Erica has a growing baby bump in March during the Emmy Award Ceremony.

It’s not entertainment; it’s art. She’s very inspiring. She’s definitely the artist of the family… I am just a TV actor who pays the bills.”<p class=align-left>It all sounds cute and sweet. Moreover, in the same interview, the actor told an interesting fact about his daughter. The matter is that on many websites one may found Peter and Erica Schmidt baby’s name written in a wrong way! That is what the man said:</p>“Let me tell you right now: her name is not Zelig.
