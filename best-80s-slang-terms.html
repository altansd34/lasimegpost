This 80s slang was so much more than just what you said—it was just as much about the attitude you had while saying it.&nbsp;</p><p>Certain expressions from the 80s are still making the rounds today. But, for the most part, when expressions like “gnarly” are used now, it’s usually to make fun of how people used to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we discuss the 15 best slang words from the 80s, what they mean and how to use them!</p><li><a href=#>Bad</a></li><li><a href=#>Bitchin’</a></li><li><a href=#>Bod</a></li><li><a href=#>Choice</a></li><li><a href=#>Gag me with a spoon</a></li><li><a href=#>Gnarly</a></li><li><a href=#>No doy/no duh</a></li><li><a href=#>Not even</a></li><li><a href=#>Psych</a></li><li><a href=#>Radical</a></li><li><a href=#>Ralph</a></li><li><a href=#>Scarf</a></li><li><a href=#>Take a chill pill</a></li><li><a href=#>Veg out</a></li><li><a href=#>Wannabe</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Bad>1. Bad</h2><p>In the 80s, if you wanted to show approval for something, you called it “bad.” That’s right: Confusingly, “bad” meant that something was, in fact, very good.</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“You’re looking bad in that denim jacket, man!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Bitchin’>2. Bitchin’</h2><p>The term “bitchin’” was actually first used in the 1960s; however, it rose to popularity again in the 80s, thanks to its use in popular culture, including the movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Back to the Future Part II</a>. At any rate, this long-standing slang word means “cool” or “awesome.”</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Are you going to Brody’s birthday this weekend? His parties are always bitchin’!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Bod>3. Bod</h2><p>This one might be obvious: It’s an abbreviated term for “body.” It was used primarily when making a positive comment about someone’s physical appearance (a popular activity in the 80s).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Whoa! Check out your bod! Have you been hitting the gym lately?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Choice>4. Choice</h2><p>In the 80s, if you called something “choice,” it meant you really liked it. This term was often used for high-quality items like an expensive article of clothing or a nice car.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Those leather boots are choice! Did you get them at the mall?”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Gag-me-with-a-spoon>5. Gag me with a spoon</h2><p>Want to show your disgust with something? Just say “Gag me with a spoon”! This was a common phrase to react to something gross.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Ugh! Did someone heat up fish in the microwave? Gag me with a spoon!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Gnarly>6. Gnarly</h2><p>Originally, the word “gnarly” referred to something twisted (gnarled) or bad—for example, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">surfers used it</a> to talk about a difficult wave to ride. But it eventually started being used to describe something good. To use a word like this properly, you have to make sure you say it with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">California accent</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“I love how your hair is short on top and long in the back. It looks gnarly!”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-No-doy/no-duh>7. No doy/no duh</h2><p>If you wanted to convey that someone just said something really obvious—and that you’d have to be very dumb not to know it—you’d respond with a “No doy” or “No duh.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Speaker 1:<strong> </strong>“Did you know that people in Germany speak German?”&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 2: “Uh… no doy!”</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Not-even>8. Not even</h2><p>“Not even” was a quick way to respond to someone when they said something you disagreed with; it was basically like saying “No, you’re wrong!” (but much cooler, of course). You could also use it as a negative response to a question.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p><p>Speaker 1: “Why are you always staring at my brother? I think you’re in love with him.”</p><p>Speaker 2: “Not even!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Psych>9. Psych</h2><p>You would use this term in the 80s to let someone know that you had just tricked them by making them believe something that wasn’t true. Hearing someone yell “Psych!” at you could make you feel like the biggest dummy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Speaker 1: “Did you hear? The principal said we’ve learned enough, so he canceled school for the rest of the year.”</p><p>Speaker 2: “Really? That’s awesome!”</p><p>Speaker 1: “Psych! Hehehehe.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Radical>10. Radical</h2><p>This was a common expression of approval, much like “gnarly” or “bitchin’.” Often shortened to “rad,” you might still hear this one in use today!</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“You’re going to Hawaii for winter vacation? Radical!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=11.-Ralph>11. Ralph</h2><p>Ralph is not just a name! It was also an 80s word that meant “vomit.” You could use this literally, or when you wanted to emphasize your disgust at something.</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“Those shoes are so ugly they make me want to ralph!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=12.-Scarf>12. Scarf</h2><p>Ever been so hungry or had something so delicious that you stuffed food into your mouth at record speed? That’s scarfing! In other words, to “scarf” is to eat a lot of food quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“I was starving after volleyball practice and I scarfed a whole pizza by myself.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=13.-Take-a-chill-pill>13. Take a chill pill</h2><p>If someone was stressing out, it was common to hear someone else tell them to “Take a chill pill!” This was basically a not very sensitive way to tell someone to relax.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“I’m sure you didn’t fail the exam. Take a chill pill!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=14.-Veg-out>14. Veg out</h2><p>You know those days when you’re just sitting around relaxing and not really focusing on anything? In the 80s, this would be called “veggin’ out”! This term is actually still used pretty regularly nowadays.</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“I’ve had such a long week at work. I just want to go home and veg out!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=15.-Wannabe>15. Wannabe</h2><p>Long before the Spice Girls released their famous song, the term “wannabe” was used to describe a person who wanted to be like someone else or achieve a certain status. In case you couldn’t tell, it comes from the words “want to be.”</p><p><strong>How to use it: </strong>“My little sister started borrowing my clothes and doing her hair like mine. She’s such a wannabe!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Build some bitchin’ vocabulary</h2><p>The words we explored above might seem a little silly—maybe even completely ridiculous. But they’re a lot of fun to use. Get to know more 80s slang words and try using them <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with your friends</a>.
