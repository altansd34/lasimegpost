But don’t let what&nbsp;I said mislead you! It’s very well possible for you to&nbsp;come across one of&nbsp;these underwater animals during a&nbsp;walk at&nbsp;the beach. So, take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;them carefully now, and you might just avoid a&nbsp;disaster.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/44a/aee/db654a5eac9b4ce242437094fe.png><p>Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;fish or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;stone? What you are looking at&nbsp;is&nbsp;commonly known as&nbsp;the stonefish, but its fancier names include “The Dornorn” and “Synanceia”. If&nbsp;you are into diving and observing the underwater you might already have come across one without noticing. Its appearance makes it&nbsp;almost impossible to&nbsp;distinguish it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;real stone due to&nbsp;its gray coloration and mottled appearance. Especially if&nbsp;you’re wearing fogged snorkel goggles... So, you better pay attention because otherwise, the consequences can be&nbsp;unfortunate since stonefishes are the most venomous fish known.</p><p>Although some types of&nbsp;stonefishes are known to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;rivers, most of&nbsp;them are found in&nbsp;coral reefs near the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. Their needle-like dorsal fin spines stick up&nbsp;when they are disturbed or&nbsp;threatened, and inject the poison they contain. The most common reason why stonefish stings occur is&nbsp;swimmers stepping on&nbsp;them without realizing&nbsp;it. However, you don’t need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> to&nbsp;get stung. Since they can survive out of&nbsp;the water for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;twenty-four hours, you will have to&nbsp;watch where you step when you’re at&nbsp;the beach as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Those who got stung by&nbsp;stonefish describe their experience to&nbsp;be&nbsp;extremely distressing. Their <a href=# title=venom data-link=tag>venom</a> can result in&nbsp;infection. And in&nbsp;some cases, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;known to&nbsp;cause shock and paralysis. It&nbsp;might come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;shock but despite its bad reputation, stonefish is&nbsp;edible if&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;prepared properly. When the fish is&nbsp;heated, its venom breaks down. And if&nbsp;the dorsal fins, which are the main source of&nbsp;its venom, are removed, raw stonefish is&nbsp;served as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;sashimi, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e6c/860/fcb14f5270a533fbe420bf0fde.png><p>This creature might look like it&nbsp;came out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;science-fiction movie, but it’s very much real! Say hello to&nbsp;blue-ringed octopuses! Don’t be&nbsp;deceived by&nbsp;their small size, which can range between 5&nbsp;and 8&nbsp;inches including their arms, because they are packed with venom to&nbsp;cause great damage to&nbsp;as&nbsp;many as&nbsp;twenty-six people within minutes! Just like stonefishes, blue-ringed octopuses are found in&nbsp;the Pacific and Indian oceans, from <a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a> to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>. They typically live on&nbsp;coral reefs and rocky areas of&nbsp;the seafloor. Some may also be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;tide pools, seagrass, and algal beds.</p><p>Blue-ringed octopuses are not aggressive in&nbsp;<a href=# title=nature data-link=tag>nature</a>. When they are not seeking <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a>, such as&nbsp;crabs and shrimps, or&nbsp;searching for a&nbsp;mate, they often hide in&nbsp;marine debris, shells, or&nbsp;crevices. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;only if&nbsp;they are provoked, cornered, or&nbsp;handled that they get dangerous to&nbsp;humans.</p><p>When they are threatened, they turn bright yellow, and blue iridescent rings appear all over their body as&nbsp;a&nbsp;warning display towards the potential predators. Their bites usually come unnoticed, so&nbsp;you might not be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;realize you’re bitten until it’s too late. The venom of&nbsp;a&nbsp;blue-ringed octopus can cause dizziness and loss of&nbsp;senses and motor skills, and ultimately paralysis. So, better try to&nbsp;keep your hands to&nbsp;yourself and back away in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry if&nbsp;you see one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0c6/890/f70795574394ba795286d80896.png><p>Nope, it’s not a&nbsp;flower bouquet... So, don’t try to&nbsp;pick and smell one of&nbsp;those pink tube-like things...! What’s standing before your eyes is&nbsp;a&nbsp;marine animal called a&nbsp;flower urchin. It&nbsp;may look gorgeous, but don’t let the looks deceive you. It&nbsp;was named the most dangerous sea urchin in&nbsp;the 2014 Guinness World Records. Flower urchins inhabit the tropical areas of&nbsp;the Indo-West Pacific and are found among coral reefs, rocks, sand, and seagrass beds at&nbsp;depths of&nbsp;0&nbsp;to&nbsp;295&nbsp;feet.</p><p>The most noticeable feature of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;their pedicellaria, which are claw-shaped defensive organs that are also found in&nbsp;sea stars. What makes flower urchins differ from any other sea urchin is&nbsp;the fact that their pedicellaria&nbsp;is, as&nbsp;the name suggests, flower-like and usually pinkish-white to&nbsp;yellowish-white in&nbsp;color with a&nbsp;central purple dot. Hidden underneath these “flowers” they possess short and blunt spines.</p><p>Although many sea urchins deliver their venom through such spines, flower urchins deliver their venom through their pedicellaria or&nbsp;“flowers”. If&nbsp;they are undisturbed, the tips of&nbsp;these flowers are usually expanded into round cup-like shapes. On&nbsp;their surfaces, they possess tiny sensors with which they can detect threats. And once they contact such threats, these flowers immediately snap shut and start injecting venom. What’s weird is&nbsp;that the little claws of&nbsp;the flowers can sometimes break off from their stalks, stick to&nbsp;the point of&nbsp;contact, and continue injecting venom for hours into whoever touched&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/335/70b/0b6f5555d0b1a5d91db0627f9e.png><p>Looks like a&nbsp;giant puddle of&nbsp;melted raspberry ice cream, right? You wish... It’s a&nbsp;lion’s mane jellyfish, which is&nbsp;also called giant jellyfish, arctic red jellyfish, or&nbsp;hair jelly. They are known to&nbsp;prefer cool water. That’s why they can mostly be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. But it’s possible to&nbsp;spot them around the Britain Isles and in&nbsp;Scandinavian waters, too. Lion’s mane jellyfish are one of&nbsp;the largest known species of&nbsp;jellyfish.</p><p>They get their name from their long flowing hair-like tentacles that can reach lengths up&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;feet. And although the average bell diameter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lion’s mane jellyfish is&nbsp;around 20&nbsp;inches, they can sometimes attain a&nbsp;diameter of&nbsp;over 7&nbsp;feet. The largest lion’s mane jellyfish recorded was seen in&nbsp;1865 off the coast of&nbsp;Massachusetts. It&nbsp;was measured to&nbsp;have tentacles around 120 feet long and a&nbsp;diameter of&nbsp;7&nbsp;feet. To&nbsp;help you picture&nbsp;it, this is&nbsp;longer than a&nbsp;blue whale!</p><p>Lion’s mane jellyfish hunt by&nbsp;extending their tentacles outward and creating a&nbsp;trap to&nbsp;catch their food. Since they have around one thousand two hundred stinging tentacles, the fish would have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;extremely lucky to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;escape them. The sting of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lion’s mane jellyfish is&nbsp;usually not life-threatening, but you would still want to&nbsp;avoid swimming into its tentacles because it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;very painful to&nbsp;humans. And if&nbsp;you see one washed up&nbsp;on&nbsp;the beach, better not touch it&nbsp;since it&nbsp;can still deliver a&nbsp;sting long after they’ve been on&nbsp;the shore.</p><p>Fun fact: the lion’s mane jellyfish appears in&nbsp;the Sherlock Holmes story “The Adventure of&nbsp;the Lion’s Mane” as&nbsp;a&nbsp;suspect. But don’t worry, we&nbsp;won’t give any spoilers!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/15a/46e/e33eb052afa32c716ab7eaf2fe.png><p>The last marine animal you’re seeing now is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sea snake! And yes, they are different from eels... There are sixty-nine identified species of&nbsp;sea snakes. Most of&nbsp;them can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;the tropical and subtropical waters of&nbsp;the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and they have been around for millions of&nbsp;years.</p><p>To&nbsp;make things easier, scientists have separated all different species of&nbsp;sea snakes into two categories: true sea snakes and sea kraits. Whereas true sea snakes spend almost all their time at&nbsp;sea, sea kraits can spend some time on&nbsp;the land as&nbsp;well. If&nbsp;you see a&nbsp;snake on&nbsp;the beach, you can tell whether that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;land or&nbsp;a&nbsp;sea snake by&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;its tail. If&nbsp;it’s paddle-like, then that’s a&nbsp;sea snake you got there! But make sure to&nbsp;keep your distance in&nbsp;both cases...</p><p>All sea snakes need to&nbsp;surface regularly to&nbsp;breathe since they have no&nbsp;gills. That’s why you can come across one while swimming. If&nbsp;that happens, you better swim away as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;you can because most sea snakes have more venom than the average cobra or&nbsp;rattlesnake. However, since they only attack if&nbsp;provoked, bites are quite rare. One more cool fact about sea snakes! They are the only reptiles to&nbsp;give birth in&nbsp;the oceans!</p><p>The majority of&nbsp;sea snakes keep the eggs within themselves and give birth to&nbsp;nearly fully formed snakes while swimming. That is&nbsp;except for the yellow-lipped sea krait though. They come onto land to&nbsp;lay the eggs of&nbsp;their little ones. Remember the stonefish from the beginning of&nbsp;our tour? They are hunted by&nbsp;sea snakes! Blame the food chain...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGarlZp6tbTErJxmnpykxKa%2B0magp2WknbJuu8KemKdll5rBbrvUrWSonl2ptaZ51pqrnqpdbX51fZNxZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./im-a-hot-grandma-who-wears-tight-clothes-trolls-cant-accept-that-i-dont-look-my-age-816696.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Im a Hot Grandma, and I Refuse to Dress My Age">&larr;
