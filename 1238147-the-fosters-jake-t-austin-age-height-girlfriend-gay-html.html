Austin The Fosters</h2><p class=align-left>If you are a fan of drama television series, then I am sure amongst your favourites is the American family drama television series The Fosters. The drama series is an artistic creation of the talented Peter Paige and Bradley Bredeweg. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Fosters premiered</a> in the United States on Freeform on 3rd June in 2013. The storyline of the drama series revolves around the life of a lesbian couple Stef and Lena, who are a cop and school vice principal respectively.</p><p class=align-left>Stef and Lena are exemplary parents trying to raise one of their biological child and four other adopted children in San Diego, California. When the first season of this drama series hit the televisions, both fans and critics gave favourable reviews primarily due to its portrayal of the LGBT themes. In The Fosters, Jake portrayed Jesus Adams Foster. Jesus is the son of Stef and Lena, sibling to Jude, Brandon, and Callie, and the twin brother of Mariana. Marian and Jesus share a lot of hatred towards their biological mother.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9afeb30bd7809772.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jake DeVito biography: who is one of Danny Devito’s children?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Adams has ADHD and is a member of the wrestling team. He joins the team intending to fight off the adverse effects of his treatment as recommended by his pal Mike. Adams begins off as a womanizer but eventually becomes more respectful after getting back together with Emma. Adams strong bond with Marianna is seen when he covers up for her wrongdoings more than once. Despite nailing the character Adams very well, Jake only premiered in season one and two of this hit drama television series.</p><h2>Why did Jake T. Austin leave The Fosters?</h2><p class=align-left>When fans watched the third season of The Fosters and saw the character Adams had a new face, admirers of Austin could not help but wonder what had happened to prompt him to leave.
