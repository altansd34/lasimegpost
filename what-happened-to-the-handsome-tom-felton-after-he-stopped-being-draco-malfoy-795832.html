In&nbsp;his regular life, he’s totally different from his famous character and in&nbsp;his career, he&nbsp;tried everything in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;shake off that image.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> want to&nbsp;learn more about how Tom Felton’s professional life is&nbsp;going these days and why there isn’t a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;current news about him. We&nbsp;also want to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;he’s been successful at&nbsp;making viewers forget that he&nbsp;was once Draco Malfoy.</p><p><h2>1995: a&nbsp;child actor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/423/960/5243d253b6b4a41d715c53c37b.jpg><p>Tom Felton, the fourth child in&nbsp;the Felton family, was born in&nbsp;1987. Felton has always been very artistic and he&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;on&nbsp;set for the first time when he&nbsp;was just 8&nbsp;years old. He&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;episodes in&nbsp;several series and then his mother’s friend helped him get an&nbsp;audition for <a href=#>The Borrowers</a>. Felton was chosen from 400 other candidates.</p><p>His career continued after the film was released and the talented boy was invited to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;3&nbsp;other projects, and one of&nbsp;them became really famous. It&nbsp;was the film, Anna and the King where the 11-year-old Felton starred alongside Jodie Foster.</p><p><h2>2000: A&nbsp;big role that would last for 10&nbsp;years</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/145/ee6/de81e156f0a3107ef25303aa6c.jpg><p>When the young 13-year-old actor came to&nbsp;the casting of&nbsp;Harry Potter, he&nbsp;admitted that he&nbsp;<a href=#>hadn’t read </a>the book that everyone loved so&nbsp;much. And he&nbsp;didn’t really believe he&nbsp;would get the role, but he&nbsp;did! He&nbsp;was even considered for the role of&nbsp;Harry in&nbsp;the beginning but producers decided he&nbsp;would look much better as&nbsp;the bad guy.</p><p>Felton was happy because he&nbsp;thought that the bad guy would stir more emotions and would be&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;master. But in&nbsp;real life, Felton is&nbsp;fun and kind, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;work a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;fully become the character.</p><p>After the first film was released, Felton noticed that even his friends became more cautious around him. He&nbsp;was really convincing as&nbsp;Draco and had almost as&nbsp;many fans as&nbsp;Harry. Even Harry Potter author J.&nbsp;K.&nbsp;Rowling was shocked by&nbsp;this and admitted that she <a href=#>didn’t like Draco</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/250/a00/13d45e5594a74584bcb7b6e193.jpg><p>Felton’s teenage years were busy with work and he&nbsp;sometimes even regretted taking part in&nbsp;the franchise. The limitations he&nbsp;experienced didn’t allow him to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;many other films. For example, he&nbsp;couldn’t change his hairstyle and he&nbsp;couldn’t get a&nbsp;tan or&nbsp;do&nbsp;any extreme sports. So&nbsp;when he&nbsp;finished acting in&nbsp;the Harry Potter series, he&nbsp;was finally liberated from these annoying rules.</p><p><h2>2011: Felton shocked fans by&nbsp;changing his profession.</h2></p><p>After the Harry Potter series, Felton decided it&nbsp;was time for him to&nbsp;stop his acting career. He&nbsp;tried himself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;rapper and even recorded several albums. He&nbsp;started a&nbsp;YouTube <a href=#>channel</a> where he&nbsp;posted videos of&nbsp;his own songs. But they didn’t become very popular.</p><p>He&nbsp;also wanted to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;professional fisherman but, fortunately for the fans, he&nbsp;changed his mind.</p><p><h2>2012&nbsp;— today: a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;different roles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a85/582/40989f5ae98d41e61c306fcd33.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Tom Felton in&nbsp;In&nbsp;Secret, 2013</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;popular opinion that directors don’t want Tom Felton in&nbsp;their movies, but this is&nbsp;not true. The actor has appeared in&nbsp;more than 15&nbsp;movies since Harry Potter finished and he&nbsp;portrayed very different characters. The most famous of&nbsp;these films were <a href=#>Rise of&nbsp;the Planet of&nbsp;the Apes</a> and <a href=#>The Happening</a>, along with the series, <a href=#>The Flash</a>.</p><p>The actor’s most recent film was <a href=#>Ophelia</a> which was released in&nbsp;2018. Felton has joked that Draco’s image haunted him throughout the years. He&nbsp;played the brother of&nbsp;Daisy Ridley’s character and the relationship between the actors was quite cold in&nbsp;the beginning. He&nbsp;even <a href=#>told</a> Daily Mail:</p><p>“At&nbsp;first&nbsp;I thought she didn’t like&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was only at&nbsp;the end that it&nbsp;changed. I&nbsp;think she’s quite a&nbsp;big Harry Potter fan, so&nbsp;I think she was just freaking out that Draco was her brother! She was a&nbsp;bit quiet with&nbsp;me, she didn’t say too much. I&nbsp;may have got that wrong I’m not sure. But we&nbsp;warmed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;each other after a&nbsp;while. We&nbsp;just had to&nbsp;break the ice a&nbsp;bit that was all.”</p><p>But still, after Harry Potter, not a&nbsp;single one of&nbsp;Felton’s characters have gotten even close to&nbsp;Draco and he&nbsp;usually appears in&nbsp;supporting roles. Critics think this is&nbsp;because he’s not very ambitious.</p><p>Felton says that at&nbsp;times, he’s not confident. This was especially evident right after he&nbsp;finished working on&nbsp;Harry Potter. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;said it&nbsp;was disheartening to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;auditions over and over again and to&nbsp;hear, “We’ll call you.” The actor said he&nbsp;was really nervous every time he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;audition for anything.</p><p><h2>2019: personal life and plans</h2></p><p>Fans joke that Felton’s Instagram page is&nbsp;more popular than the movies he&nbsp;appears&nbsp;in. He&nbsp;has 5.6 million subscribers and he&nbsp;often has live conversations with his followers. He&nbsp;plays guitar, piano, and sings songs he&nbsp;composes.</p><p>Felton has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=# title=hobbies data-link=tag>hobbies</a> and spends his free time fishing, playing basketball and soccer, ice skating, golfing, and meeting up&nbsp;with friends.</p><p>Tom also does a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;charity work and even donated a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the money he&nbsp;earned for playing the role of&nbsp;Draco.</p><p>He&nbsp;doesn’t like talking about his career plans and says that he&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;live and work so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;has pleasure. The last show he&nbsp;appeared in&nbsp;was <a href=#>Origin</a> where Felton played a&nbsp;bad guy whose name was Logan. Interestingly, Natalia Tena, who played Nymphadora Tonks in&nbsp;Harry Potter, also appeared in&nbsp;the show. And in&nbsp;2020, the film <a href=#>The Forgotten Battle</a> is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;released, featuring Felton in&nbsp;a&nbsp;leading role.</p><p>What’s your opinion on&nbsp;this actor and his career thus far?
