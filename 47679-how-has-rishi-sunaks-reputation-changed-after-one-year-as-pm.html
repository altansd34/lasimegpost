But what about the PM’s own reputation – how has public opinion on the man himself changed over the last 12 months?</p><p data-block-key=3bhj5>On the eve of his accession to 10 Downing Street, public expectations for Rishi Sunak were mixed: 25% expected him to be “good” or “great” as prime minister, 29% “average”, and 29% “poor” or “terrible”.</p><p data-block-key=eg27n>A year into the job, Sunak has not lived up to these limited expectations. Half of Britons say he has been a poor or terrible PM (50%), while just 11% think he has been good or great. A third consider him average (33%), which is the prevailing opinion among Conservative voters, at 48%. Three in ten Tory voters (29%) rate Sunak’s first year in office badly, while 20% think his performance has been positive.</p><h3 data-block-key=7lx5x id="britons-distrust-rishi-sunak's-judgement-across-all-policy-areas-asked-about">Britons distrust Rishi Sunak’s judgement across all policy areas asked about</h3><p data-block-key=fr7oa>Rishi Sunak came to prominence with a promise of economic aptitude. Our previous poll at the time he took office found it was the only issue among 12 on which a clear margin of Britons had confidence in his decision-making, by 50% to 31%.</p><p data-block-key=9589n>That trust has since evaporated, with only 31% placing trust in the PM to effectively manage the economy, while 62% have little to no confidence in him. This represents a 45 point shift in net terms from +14 to -31 – the worst shift across all issues we asked about.</p><p data-block-key=925mr>Sunak’s reputation has taken a hammering across the board though, with net decreases of at least fifteen points in every category. Sunak is least trusted on immigration (75% distrust him), housing (72%), the NHS (72%) and the cost of living (71%). Worryingly for the prime minister, his worst-performing issues cover three of his five ‘pledges’ from the beginning of the year.</p><h3 data-block-key=5oejb id="sunak's-prized-reputation-for-competence-and-decisiveness-has-disappeared">Sunak’s prized reputation for competence and decisiveness has disappeared</h3><p data-block-key=tnte>Rishi Sunak’s pitch to Conservative members at last year’s leadership contest was that he was the candidate of competence. And indeed, as he took office, Britons agreed that he was a competent character, by 50% to 22%.</p><p data-block-key=8vcm2>That prized reputation for competence is now gone, with the public now seeing him as incompetent by 46% to 34%. This represents a 40 point net drop, from +28 to -12.</p><p data-block-key=c86f6>Sunak’s personal reputation is diminished on all fronts, but in no area more than decisiveness. Here he was seen his reputation as a decisive politician go from a net score of +37 to -19 – a 55 point drop.</p><p data-block-key=3dg2q>Belief that Sunak is strong rather than weak has also taken a substantial knock, falling from +15 last year to -35 now.</p><p data-block-key=6j9ir>Currently, the best that can be said for Sunak by the public is that he is not racist (+50) and not lazy (+40).</p><h3 data-block-key=iavq3>Rishi Sunak is still seen as an improvement over Liz Truss and Boris Johnson</h3><p data-block-key=6jg3h>Upon taking over from Liz Truss, 68% of Britons said that they expected Rishi Sunak would be a better prime minister than this short-lived predecessor. One year on, the public still thinks that, although at a diminished rate of 59%.</p><p data-block-key=1ofv4>They still likewise tend to think that Sunak is an improvement on Boris Johnson, with 38% saying so (compared to 41% last year). The number who think he is worse than Johnson has risen slightly, however, from 15% to 22%.</p><p data-block-key=12ioa>Sunak fares less well compared to other prime ministers, however. The public are now torn in a three way split when comparing Rishi Sunak and Theresa May – 30% say May is better, 28% say Sunak is superior, and 31% see them as about the same. In 2022, only 16% had thought Sunak would turn out to be worse than May.</p><p data-block-key=6hs21>Likewise, David Cameron is looking a better PM than Sunak to many Britons. The number saying Cameron is superior to Sunak has increased from 20% to 36%, while at the same time the number who consider Sunak to be the better of the pair has fallen from 25% to 16%.</p><p data-block-key=72bfh>Britons are also more likely to think that Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, John Mayor and Margaret Thatcher were better PMs than Sunak has been than think the opposite.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGyDeIWMoaawZZiWwG6%2ByKyfomWjqruit9JmqZ6opamutbXOp2ScoJGjtKawjJqdrZ2iYryvsYyynJqqXZbAbrzM</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-money-does-byron-nelson-make-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Byron Nelson Make?
