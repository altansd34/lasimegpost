Only 17% say it only happened once or twice.</p><p>Bullying as an adult seems to have been less sustained: a lower figure of 23% of victims say it happened many times. Around half say they were subjected to bullying several times (47%), while 28% say it happened only once or twice.</p><h3>Majority of bullied Britons say being targeted by bullies had a significant impact on their life</h3><p>Three-quarters of people who were bullied as an adult say the experience impacted their life a great deal (35%) or a fair amount (39%).</p><p>In comparison, one in five of those bullied as children (20%) say it had a great deal of impact while 37% say it had a fair amount of impact on their life.</p><p>Just 4% of Britons targeted by bullies in adulthood say it had no impact on their life, while one in ten (10%) of those bullied as children say the same.</p><h3>Classmates blamed by most of those bullied as children</h3><p>Nearly nine in ten (87%) of those who were bullied in childhood say they were bullied by a classmate, with friends (15%) and teachers (13%) also among the culprits cited.</p><p>And a significant proportion of those Britons say they were targeted by members of their own family, including 12% who were bullied by a parent, 11% by a sibling and 5% by another family member.</p><h3>One in five bullied adults say they were targeted by their partner</h3><p>A significant proportion of Britons bullied as an adult say they have suffered at the hands of those who arguably should love them the most – their spouse or partner.</p><p>One in five (20%) report being bullied by a partner, while 16% have been bullied by other family members, including 8% who say they were bullied by a parent and 6% who were bullied by a sibling.</p><p>However, the most likely source of bullying in adulthood is the workplace – more than half of those bullied as adults (56%) say they have been bullied by a boss or manager and 47% by a colleague.</p><h3>Most Britons bullied as children were physically attacked</h3><p>Around six in ten Britons (58%) bullied in childhood say their bully physically attacked them, including 11% who say they were attacked “many times”.</p><p>Men are more likely than women to have been physically set upon by their childhood bully, at 68% to 48%.</p><p>But when it comes to bullying in adulthood, the gender gap narrows – 21% of those who say they were bullied as an adult report being attacked at least once or twice, including 19% of men and 23% of women.</p><p>Those who were bullied in adulthood are more likely to describe the worst bullying they were subjected to as severe, with 71% of bullied adults saying it was compared to 49% of Britons bullied in childhood.</p><h3>Internet brings shift in the nature of bullying for young people</h3><p>The nature of bullying has shifted since the advent of the internet, with 42% of 18 to 24-year-olds who were bullied as a child saying at least some of the bullying they experienced took place online – although almost all say they were also bullied in person<strong>.</strong></p><p>One in six Britons (18%) who have experienced bullying as an adult say at least part of it happened online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZWeFdnnMmqGoqpmpxm6u0aKrqKajYrWiwsRmmZ6dnmKvtrjLopydZZGjsW6102afmpxdqLaoug%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-story-of-susan-boyle-who-shook-the-world-with-her-modesty-and-talent-806785.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Story of Susan Boyle That Teaches Us to Never Judge a Book by Its Cover">&larr;
