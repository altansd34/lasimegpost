Most people have found themselves in this dilemma of being friend-zoned. Finding yourself in the friend zone with someone you really like can be frustrating and heartbreaking. Do you know how to get out of the friend zone when you find yourself in these murky waters?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/9db361f0eb473665.jpeg><p class=align-left>Can you get out of the friend zone? The answer is yes. Unrequited love is hard enough, even more so if the person of interest offers you just friendship. The reality that your feelings are not reciprocated with the waited-for echo hurts deeply. Luckily, there are workable tactics to get out of the friend zone territory and enter the romantic zone.</p><h2>How to get out of the friend zone</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/19bfe72aa0770800.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ love memes for every occasion to send to your significant other</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The friend zone exists, and breaking free from it can be one of the most difficult experiences you'll ever have in a relationship. Here are 27 strategies for breaking out of the friend zone.</p><h3>1. Flirt with your crush</h3><p class=align-left>When you like your friend, one big question that comes to your mind is how to escape the friend zone. Flirting is the fastest way to get out of the friend zone. Send your crush a <a href=#>flirty message</a> that will surprise them.</p><p class=align-left>Texting them something pleasantly unexpected will surprise them and can change the way they see you. They stop thinking of you as a just friend and see you as a potential dating mate. Flirting can be done by sending flirty texts and talking in a flirty way.</p><h3>2. Become mysterious</h3><p class=align-left>Be a little mysterious and spice the friendship by acting differently once in a while. You can also avoid texting and calling when they expect, making them curious.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top flirty memes to send your partner when bored</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Instead, keep them intrigued and let them want to know what you are up to. This will create interest, and who knows who, this might be a start of a great romance.</p><h3>3. Make them a little jealousy</h3><p class=align-left>If you are wondering how to get out of the friend zone with a girl you like, make her jealous. Girls quickly fall prey to the green-eyed monster when it comes to matters of the heart.</p><p class=align-left>Hang around people of the opposite s*x and tell them you have been having fun. Have fun with other people and show them that you have a life beyond them. A little competition and jealousy will make them eager to spend time with and have your affection.</p><h3>4. Tell the truth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/19bfe72aa0770800.jpeg><p class=align-left>The truth will always set you free. But when it comes to matters of the heart, confessing may be one of the hardest things to do. It requires a lot of courage on your side, but at least you will get a straight answer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/008a982bfe9f8bcf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 best Tinder openers nobody will ever dare to swipe left on</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Get into some real talk since you are already friends and talk about many things together. You need to stay positive and hope for the best after <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1477672-20-topics-talk-a-girl-a-great-conversation/ href=# title>your conversation</a>. On the other hand, prepare for the worst since they may not have the same feelings.</p><h3>5. Stop acting like a friend</h3><p class=align-left>Stop acting like just a friend if you want a <a href=#>romantic relationship</a>. That means no more teasing him too much, using a casual name, and not dressing up when you are together. Instead, change how they see you and look like a potential romantic partner.</p><h3>6. Don't show relationship signals too early</h3><p class=align-left>If you want to know how to get out of the friend zone with a guy, don't show your interest too early. They want to have fun, explore chemistry, and let things flow naturally. Showing relationship signals too soon will drive him away.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5d4ea8a548d380ba.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get out of the friend zone in 8 easy steps</span></p></a><h3>7. Ask for help</h3><p class=align-left>Most people feel better when they help their friends out. Ask for their helping hand concerning something and make them feel useful. It works even better if the help requires you to spend more time together.</p><h3>8. Look your best</h3><p class=align-left>Make an effort to look your best when you're about to meet up. Dress well and smell nice when around your crush. Do something to show them the best side of you.</p><h3>9. Ignore them</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2f67e6e919d0f2c9.jpeg><p class=align-left>How do I get out of friend zone text? To get out of a friend zone text, completely ignore them when they text you. This may sound strange, but many people only value what they are about to lose. For this reason, give them a glimpse of not having you around and make them <a href=#>miss you</a>.</p><h3>10. Be a catch</h3><p class=align-left>Make yourself a catch for your crush to notice you romantically. Treat yourself great, and this will make the <a href=#>rethink the friendship</a>. It may take long and hard work, but it will be worth it in the end.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/deb631b5ebef21bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get over someone you love – best tips</span></p></a><h3>11. Compliment them</h3><p class=align-left>Compliments go a long way in making someone like you. Genuine compliments raise the other person's esteem and make them feel valued. Throw in compliments, and you'll definitely see a <a href=#>change in the relationship</a>.</p><h3>12. Don't act desperate</h3><p class=align-left>Don't rush into expressing your feelings when you have feelings for someone. It's not an emergency. It's good to let them know but give them time to catch up if you're not on the same page yet.</p><h3>13. Focus on releasing their dopamine</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/257ab4370ecaebc5.jpeg><p class=align-left>Dopamine is the chemical that gives people pleasure. Therefore, you want to focus on increasing it when interacting with your love interest. This will make you unforgettable and maybe make them fall in love with you.</p><h3>14. Be confident</h3><p class=align-left>There is nothing as s*xy as confidence. The right amount of confidence is so hot on anyone. This will make your crush want to be more than just a friend.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/bb6877e8e7afa773.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best tips on how to get a girlfriend</span></p></a><h3>15. Physical touch</h3><p class=align-left>Touching reawakens romantic feelings when done the right way. Find a clever way to touch their arm when you talk gently. This will hint to them that you like them more than just friends.</p><h3>16. Know their romantic standards</h3><p class=align-left>Everyone has romantic standards, especially girls. Know what their ideal partner looks like and make yourself tick those boxes. This will raise your chances of them falling for you.</p><h3>17. Win their friends</h3><p class=align-left>You might be wondering why the hell you should make an effort to win their friends. Winning their friends' hearts will make them have tons of positive things to say about you. It might open their eyes to see the same.</p><h3>18. Make yourself desirable</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/008a982bfe9f8bcf.jpeg><p class=align-left>Before you make any moves, ensure you seem desirable to the person you're trying to win over.

Go for eye contact</h3><p class=align-left>Maintaining se*y eye contact is a good way to establish closeness and intimacy. Make sure you maintain eye contact from the very start of the friendship.</p><h3>20. Be there for them</h3><p class=align-left>A friend in need is a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1204873-questions-a-friend-better.html href=#>friend indeed</a>.

Surprise them with gifts</h3><p class=align-left>Most people love gifts, especially on special occasions. Therefore, ensure the gift is interesting and romantic, so they get a hint.</p><h3>22. Hang out together</h3><p class=align-left>Invite your crush to hang out with you and make sure you go to cool places. The trick here is to spend time together and, if possible, let it be for just the two of you.</p><h3>23. Be the best version of yourself</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5d4ea8a548d380ba.jpeg><p class=align-left>Focus on improving yourself and being your best.

Show them how you feel</h3><p class=align-left>If it’s impossible to tell them because you’re scared, show them how you feel. Act like you have feelings for them when you are around them.</p><h3>25. Find out why they don't like you romantically, and then fix it</h3><p class=align-left>It’s important to figure out why they like you as a friend and not romantically. You then need to fix that issue asap.</p><h3>26. Ask them out</h3><p class=align-left>To get yourself out of the friend zone, gather the courage and ask them out on a date. This might be very risky, but it is all worth it.</p><h3>27.
