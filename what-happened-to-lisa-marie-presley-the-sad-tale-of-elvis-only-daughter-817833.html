But behind the glitz and glamour of&nbsp;his life, there’s a&nbsp;story that’s often overlooked&nbsp;— the story of&nbsp;his only daughter, Lisa Marie Presley. From a&nbsp;life in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=spotlight data-link=tag>spotlight</a> to&nbsp;battles with personal demons, Lisa Marie’s journey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tragic tale of&nbsp;fame, fortune, and the price of&nbsp;living in&nbsp;the shadow of&nbsp;a&nbsp;legend. In&nbsp;this article<strong>,</strong> we’re going to&nbsp;answer in&nbsp;detail the question of&nbsp;<strong>What Happened to&nbsp;Lisa Marie Presley?</strong></p><p><h2>Early life in&nbsp;the shadow of&nbsp;greatness</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ad/b41/4e13e65dee9f21caa7151d531c.jpg><p>Associated Press/East News</p><p>Born on&nbsp;February&nbsp;1, 1968, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lisa Marie Presley</a> entered the world with the weight of&nbsp;expectation already upon her tiny shoulders. As&nbsp;the only child of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Elvis</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Priscilla Presley</a>, she was destined to&nbsp;be&nbsp;scrutinized from the moment she took her first breath. Growing up&nbsp;at&nbsp;Graceland, the Presley <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> estate in&nbsp;Memphis, Tennessee, Lisa Marie experienced a&nbsp;childhood unlike any other. Surrounded by&nbsp;luxury and adoration, she was the princess of&nbsp;rock and roll royalty. <strong>But behind closed doors, things were far from perfect.</strong></p><p>Amidst allegations of&nbsp;infidelity from both sides, Priscilla’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>involvement</a> with her karate instructor marked the tipping point in&nbsp;an&nbsp;already tumultuous marriage. Following these revelations, <strong>the couple </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>parted</strong></a><strong> ways in&nbsp;1972, when</strong> <strong>the girl was just 4&nbsp;years old.</strong></p><p>After her parents divorced, Lisa Marie found herself shuttling between her mother’s residence in&nbsp;California and her father’s famed Graceland estate in&nbsp;Memphis. <strong>The girl remained remarkably </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>attached</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;her father</strong>. Elvis would often take her for rides around the neighborhood on&nbsp;golf carts, affectionately named his 1958 Convair 880 private jet «the Lisa Marie,» and even flew her out to&nbsp;Idaho once upon learning she had never experienced snow. But Priscilla Presley was against this approach to&nbsp;raising a&nbsp;girl. One day, she’ll <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>say</a>, «Lisa had trouble learning what was right and wrong,» hinting that Presley’s influence had a&nbsp;profound effect on&nbsp;their daughter.</p><p>Lisa Marie later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>, «I&nbsp;don’t feel like&nbsp;I was spoiled. Anything my&nbsp;father did for me&nbsp;or&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;was done out of&nbsp;love, and&nbsp;I took it&nbsp;as&nbsp;that. I’m sure&nbsp;I had moments when&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;snot. But my&nbsp;mom was there to&nbsp;smack me&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the other side. Whatever he&nbsp;did, she cleaned&nbsp;up.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b19/188/ed3d055669b246d126ddfff6c1.jpg><p>Subsequently, Priscilla entered a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Michael Edwards</a>. However, <strong>her childhood was further marred by&nbsp;disturbing allegations against her mother’s partner</strong>, actor Michael Edwards, whom she accused of&nbsp;inappropriate behavior during her teenage years.</p><p>Tragedy struck once more when her father passed away suddenly at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;42&nbsp;due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;heart attack. <strong>At&nbsp;the tender age of&nbsp;9, Lisa Marie not only faced the tragic loss</strong>, but also was one of&nbsp;the first to&nbsp;discover the singer’s body. The memory left a&nbsp;profound impact on&nbsp;the young girl, who vividly remembers the last time she saw her father alive was when he&nbsp;kissed her goodnight at&nbsp;their Graceland home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d24/da3/9c9ef55c83831c16ba17337f1b.jpg><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;the events surrounding his passing, Lisa Marie candidly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, «I&nbsp;don’t like talking about this. It&nbsp;was 4am, I&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;asleep, actually. He&nbsp;found&nbsp;me.»</p><p>She discovered Elvis lying face down on&nbsp;the carpet next to&nbsp;the toilet and immediately rushed to&nbsp;call his former girlfriend, Linda Thompson, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exclaiming</a>, «<strong>My&nbsp;daddy’s dead! He’s smothered in&nbsp;the carpet!</strong>»</p><p>Despite his passing, Elvis’s body remained in&nbsp;the house after his death. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, «His body was in&nbsp;the house for three days and there was something very oddly comforting about that, which made it&nbsp;not necessarily real to&nbsp;me,» she reflected.</p><p>These early experiences of&nbsp;loss, instability, and tumult would shape Lisa Marie Presley’s life in&nbsp;profound ways. Her adolescence was marked by&nbsp;turmoil, as&nbsp;<strong>she struggled with personal demons</strong>, dropping out of&nbsp;school as&nbsp;a&nbsp;junior and descending into addictions. Seeking help, she entered Scientology’s Celebrity Center rehab facility at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;17.</p><p>Speaking about her teenage years in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2003&nbsp;interview, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «<strong>I&nbsp;was kind of&nbsp;a&nbsp;loner, a&nbsp;melancholy and strange child.</strong> I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;real self-destructive mode for a&nbsp;while.» She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>, «I&nbsp;never really fit into school. I&nbsp;didn’t really have any direction.»</p><p><h2>The legacy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Legend</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/743/fb9/9e5103500d95f77122cd0b5061.jpg><p>From an&nbsp;early age, Lisa Marie was keenly aware of&nbsp;her father’s legacy. Elvis Presley was more than just a&nbsp;musician; he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;cultural icon, a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;rebellion and revolution. His influence stretched far beyond the confines of&nbsp;the music industry, shaping the very fabric of&nbsp;American society. For Lisa Marie, living up&nbsp;to&nbsp;his legacy was a&nbsp;daunting task, one that would come to&nbsp;define much of&nbsp;her life.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;1992, she </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>made</strong></a><strong> her first demo recording.</strong> Despite being offered a&nbsp;record contract afterward, she decided to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;down.</p><p>Her debut album, «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>To&nbsp;Whom It&nbsp;May Concern</a>,» hit the shelves on&nbsp;April&nbsp;8, 2003. <strong>It&nbsp;made a&nbsp;strong entry at&nbsp;No.&nbsp;5&nbsp;on the Billboard 200 chart and earned a&nbsp;gold certification by&nbsp;June 2003.</strong> Following this success, her second album, «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Now What</a>,» was released on&nbsp;April&nbsp;5, 2005, debuting at&nbsp;No.&nbsp;9&nbsp;on the Billboard 200 and also achieving gold certification in&nbsp;November 2005.</p><p>In&nbsp;2007, Presley collaborated on&nbsp;the single «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>In&nbsp;the Ghetto</a>» with her late father, Elvis. <strong>The music video for the song soared to&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1&nbsp;on iTunes and reached No.&nbsp;16&nbsp;on the Billboard singles chart.</strong> All proceeds from the song went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;charity affiliated with Scientology. Subsequently, her third album, «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Storm and Grace</a>,» hit the shelves in&nbsp;2012.</p><p>Alongside her music endeavors, Presley held a&nbsp;significant role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;co-trustee of&nbsp;the Elvis Presley Estate, serving alongside her mother, Priscilla, and the National Bank of&nbsp;Commerce.</p><p><h2>Struggles with her demons</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/035/411/1f7b585b27aef80a371dd3cd26.jpg><p>PHOTOlink/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>As&nbsp;Lisa Marie grew older, she found herself grappling with the pressures of&nbsp;fame and the weight of&nbsp;her family name. People are increasingly worried about her condition by&nbsp;constantly asking <strong>What Happened to&nbsp;Lisa Marie Presley?</strong></p><p>The singer later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that she struggled with all the attention, «<strong>I&nbsp;didn’t ask for all the attention, so&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;phobia against&nbsp;it</strong>. I&nbsp;don’t ask tabloids to&nbsp;chase me&nbsp;around every week. But at&nbsp;the same time, I&nbsp;would never take back any part of&nbsp;who I&nbsp;am or&nbsp;where&nbsp;I came from. I&nbsp;would never want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;anything else. I’m honored and proud of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family and my&nbsp;dad.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb0/723/84f4025d63b9f72f6534d142b7.jpg><p>PHOTOlink/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Her struggles with addiction would become a&nbsp;recurring theme throughout her life, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;public meltdowns. Despite her efforts to&nbsp;get clean, the specter of&nbsp;addiction would continue to&nbsp;haunt her for years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>In&nbsp;2019, Presley <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disclosed</a> that she developed an&nbsp;addiction after her doctor prescribed pills following the birth of&nbsp;her daughters, Harper and Finley. Expressing gratitude for her survival, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attributed</a> her sobriety to&nbsp;the motivation provided by&nbsp;her four children.</p><p><h2>Five engagements, four marriages and four divorces</h2></p><p>Presley had been married four times in&nbsp;her life. <strong>Her first marriage</strong> was to&nbsp;musician <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Danny Keough</a>, which lasted from 1988 to&nbsp;1994. During this time, they welcomed two children, actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Riley Keough</a> and son <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Benjamin Keough</a>, who tragically died at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;27. Despite their divorce, Presley and Keough remained close, particularly after their son’s passing.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;their post-divorce relationship, Presley once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a>, «I&nbsp;don’t know how, but we’ve managed to&nbsp;stay close. There’s others that&nbsp;I have pain or&nbsp;betrayal associated with that&nbsp;I won’t have anything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with. But he&nbsp;and&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;special thing. Unconditional.»</p><p>Shortly after her divorce from Keough, Presley<strong> tied the knot with singer <a href=# title="Michael Jackson" data-link=tag>Michael Jackson</a></strong>, just 20&nbsp;days later. Their acquaintance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dated</a> back to&nbsp;1975 when a&nbsp;7-year-old Presley attended several of&nbsp;Jackson’s concerts in&nbsp;Las Vegas. Describing their adult <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a>, Presley saw parallels between Jackson and her father, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, «The one thing that correlates with Michael and with my&nbsp;father on&nbsp;this subject is&nbsp;that they had the luxury of&nbsp;creating whatever reality around them, they wanted to&nbsp;create. They could have the kinds of&nbsp;people who were going to&nbsp;go&nbsp;with their program or&nbsp;not go&nbsp;with their program. If&nbsp;they weren’t, then they could be&nbsp;disposed&nbsp;of.»</p><p>Presley became a&nbsp;pillar of&nbsp;support for Jackson during the public turmoil of&nbsp;accusations in&nbsp;1993, leading to&nbsp;their marriage. However, their union was short-lived, lasting only 18&nbsp;months. Despite her belief in&nbsp;Jackson’s innocence and her desire to&nbsp;save him, their relationship faced challenges, eventually leading to&nbsp;divorce.</p><p>In&nbsp;2000, Presley <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> <strong>her third engagement </strong>to&nbsp;musician John Oszajca but ended it&nbsp;upon meeting actor <a href=# title="Nicolas Cage" data-link=tag>Nicolas Cage</a> at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party. They married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret ceremony in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hawaii data-link=tag>Hawaii</a> in&nbsp;2002, on&nbsp;the 25th <a href=# title=anniversary data-link=tag>anniversary</a> of&nbsp;Elvis’ death, but divorced three months later. Presley admitted that they should never have been married.</p><p><strong>Her fourth and final </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>marriage</strong></a><strong> </strong>was to&nbsp;guitarist and music producer Michael Lockwood in&nbsp;2006. Despite Danny Keough’s role as&nbsp;best man at&nbsp;their wedding, the marriage ended in&nbsp;divorce after ten years. Presley fiercely protects her children, emphasizing their <a href=# title=happiness data-link=tag>happiness</a> and well-being as&nbsp;her top priority.</p><p><h2>Children</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fea/d88/0df7605aa2882566ef5d22ab4e.jpg><p><strong>Presley was blessed with </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>four children</strong></a>: Danielle Riley and Benjamin with her former spouse, Danny Keough, and twins Harper and Finley with her ex-husband, Michael Lockwood.</p><p>Danielle Riley Keough, known professionally as&nbsp;Riley Keough, entered the world in&nbsp;May 1989. Formerly a&nbsp;model, Riley has successfully transitioned into acting, starring in&nbsp;prominent films and&nbsp;TV series such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Logan Lucky</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Girlfriend Experience</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Daisy Jones &&nbsp;The Six</i></a>.</p><p>Presley’s second child, Benjamin Keough, arrived in&nbsp;October 1992. Despite his musical aspirations, Benjamin never released an&nbsp;album.</p><p>Fraternal twins Harper and Finley Lockwood were born in&nbsp;October 2008. During Presley’s legal dispute with Michael Lockwood, the twins were placed under the protective care of&nbsp;their grandmother, Priscilla Presley, ensuring their well-being during the challenging custody battle.</p><p><h2>The death of&nbsp;her son Benjamin in&nbsp;2020</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36e/70b/ddabdc5fd3a38cc0585d2b9757.jpg><p>The singer has endured numerous hardships in&nbsp;her life, but perhaps the most recent and undoubtedly the most difficult was the loss of&nbsp;her son, Benjamin Keough, who tragically died in&nbsp;2020&nbsp;at the age of&nbsp;27.</p><p><strong>Expressing her grief on&nbsp;Instagram after his passing, she </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>wrote</strong></a>, «My&nbsp;beautiful beautiful angel, I&nbsp;worshiped the ground you walked&nbsp;on, on&nbsp;this earth and now in&nbsp;Heaven. My&nbsp;heart and soul went with you. The depth of&nbsp;the pain is&nbsp;suffocating and bottomless without you every moment of&nbsp;every day.<br>I&nbsp;will never be&nbsp;the same. Please wait for&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;love, and hold my&nbsp;hand while&nbsp;I stay to&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;protect and raise your little sisters and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;here for Riley. I&nbsp;know you would want that.»</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;poignant essay for People Magazine, <strong>she revealed the devastation she felt following her son’s death, </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>stating</strong></a>, «I’ve had more than anyone’s fair share of&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;lifetime, and somehow, I’ve made it&nbsp;this far. But this one, the death of&nbsp;my&nbsp;beautiful, beautiful son? The sweetest and most incredible being that&nbsp;I have ever had the privilege of&nbsp;knowing, who made me&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;honored every single day to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his mother? Who was so&nbsp;much like his grandfather on&nbsp;so&nbsp;many levels that he&nbsp;actually scared&nbsp;me? Which made me&nbsp;worry about him even more than&nbsp;I naturally would have? No. Just no.<br>It’s a&nbsp;real choice to&nbsp;keep going, one that&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;make every single day and one that is&nbsp;constantly challenging, to&nbsp;say the least. But I&nbsp;keep going for my&nbsp;girls. I&nbsp;keep going because my&nbsp;son made it&nbsp;very clear in&nbsp;his final moments that taking care of&nbsp;his little sisters and looking out for them were on&nbsp;the forefront of&nbsp;his concerns and his mind. He&nbsp;absolutely adored them, and they him.»</p><p><h2>Her final days and death</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f39/b64/bf0ad058e38e6e8e944eabf5a4.jpg><p>Presley’s final notable public appearance <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>occurred</a> at&nbsp;the 2023 Golden Globe Awards on&nbsp;January&nbsp;10, 2023, where she showed her support for actor Austin Butler, who portrayed her father in&nbsp;the biopic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Elvis</i></a>. Observers noted that she appeared to&nbsp;struggle with walking down steps and speaking during an&nbsp;interview with Extra reporter Billy Bush, raising concerns about her well-being.</p><p>Tragically, just two days later, on&nbsp;January&nbsp;12, 2023, Presley <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed away</a> at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;54&nbsp;in&nbsp;California. Such a&nbsp;swift death raised questions <strong>What Happened to&nbsp;Lisa Marie Presley? </strong>Initial reports indicated that she had experienced cardiac arrest. However, an&nbsp;autopsy report revealed that a&nbsp;small bowel obstruction, stemming from scar tissue resulting from previous bariatric surgery, led to&nbsp;her cardiac arrest.</p><p>Presley was laid to&nbsp;rest at&nbsp;Graceland, where her memorial service took place on&nbsp;January&nbsp;22, 2023. Over&nbsp;1,000 individuals gathered on&nbsp;the front lawn to&nbsp;pay their respects, with performances by&nbsp;The Smashing Pumpkins lead singer Barry Corgan, Alanis Morissette, and Axl Rose adding to&nbsp;the somber atmosphere of&nbsp;the service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/758/ee6/55c497540cbb5b23c5c4cbb4be.jpg><p>The life story of&nbsp;Lisa Marie Presley is&nbsp;a&nbsp;poignant reminder of&nbsp;the highs and lows of&nbsp;fame, fortune, and family.

But through it&nbsp;all, she has remained true to&nbsp;herself and her music, finding redemption in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;adversity.
