You make my knees weak and give me butterflies in my tummy. It's a great sensation to be with you.</li><li>We came together underneath the stars above. What started as liking soon turned into love. I sensed a certain something in my heart that was true. I know I have waited all my life to fall in love with you.</li><li>Hey, I hope this message finds you well. I just wanted to let you know that you've been on my mind a lot lately. Every time I see your smile, hear your laugh, or just think about the way you make me feel, my heart skips a beat. So, what do you say? Are you up for taking a chance on us?</li><li>You encourage me to grow. Every part of me desires to be with every part of you. My want to be with you is unfathomable, and your presence makes me better.</li><li>You're so beautiful, thoughtful, and smart. You're a perfect angel, even when you're less than ideal. I love every part of you, faults and fabulous points alike.</li><li>Hey princess, I just wanted to tell you that you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. You remind me of those all-so-perfect Disney princesses that we all know.</li><li>You must be an angel sent down from Heaven to look after me. You are the perfect person for me.

You make me feel comfortable and accepted in a way that I haven't felt before.</li><li>The important thing is I don't want to be without you for the next 20 years, or 40, or however many there are. I've gotten very used to being happy, and I love you very much indeed.</li><li>I love the way that you make me laugh, my darling. Spending time with you is so much fun. I hope that we can laugh together for the rest of my life.</li><li>I have been in love with you since day one, I don't know how it happened, and I have no idea why, but I feel blessed that it did. You are the queen of my life, and I promise I will always treat you like one.</li><li>Every day, as soon as I wake up, I think of you and wish that I was waking up with you, and every night before I fall asleep, I think of you and wish that I was falling asleep with you.</li><li>Hey, my Wonder Woman, the strongest person that I know of. You have always stood like a tree in my life and given me the courage to do amazing things, so it's high time I gave you something back. Firstly, I love you so much that I could spend the rest of my life with you without thinking twice.</li><li>Words may fail to express how much I love you, but my deeds will never fail to show my love for you. I loved you yesterday and today and will love you until there's no tomorrow!</li><li>I love you not only as a partner. I love you as a best friend, a shoulder to cry on, and a beacon of strength and hope. You are everything to me.</li><li>You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better. You're the object of my desire, the number 1 Earthly reason for my existence.</li><li>I love you not only for what you are but for what I am when I am with you. I love you for what you have made of yourself and for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out.</li><li>Your love attacked my body and melted my soul.

It's like the world stops for a moment, and all I can focus on is you.</li><li>Can I say something special to you? You are everything to me; even the breath I breathe is less important than yours.
