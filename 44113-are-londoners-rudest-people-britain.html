Most people (63%) would take the last biscuit if everyone else says they don’t want it – but more than a quarter of the public (27%) say they never would, even if nobody else wanted it.</p><p>Women are notably more likely than men to see the last biscuit as totally forbidden (32% of women compared to 20% of men), while older Britons are also particularly reluctant to clean the plate (33% of those aged 65 and above).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZGZ%2BdHnAq5xmpJ%2BjsbC6xKuqZqqlmbK0wIypnKionJp6o77IrZiipg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./33089-bms-sales-benefit-lockdown-loophole-fails-grow-cus.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="B&amp;amp;Ms sales benefit from lockdown loophole, but fails to grow customer base">&larr;
