But take a closer look and you’ll notice that the story of Italy is not just the story of the country we know today, but the story of 20 smaller regions with their own terrain and history.&nbsp;</p><p>The modern version of Italy, with its 20 regions, became official only in 1912, more than five decades after the unification of the country and the proclamation of the Italian State. Each of these territories comes with its own capital city (capoluogo di regione) and each differs from the others not only in terms of landscape, but also in terms of history, traditions and, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for 5 of them, politics too</a>.</p><p>So, let’s hop on a Vespa and take a journey across Italy and its 20 regions.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Valle-d’Aosta>Valle d’Aosta</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo (capital):</strong> Aosta</p><p>The smallest and least-populated region of Italy, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Valle d’Aosta</a> nests in the Alps-Mediterranean Euroregion that borders Switzerland and France. French is in fact the second official language, and a variety of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Franco-Provençal</a> dialect is spoken by locals, too. This region is home to two of the highest peaks in Europe: Mont Blanc (4,809 m.) and Monte Rosa (4,634 m.).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Piemonte>Piemonte</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Torino</p><p>Home to the historical capital of Italy, before it was moved to Rome, the northern region of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Piemonte</a> is the second largest of the country. The most important and longest Italian river (the Po) springs here, and Piemonte also stuns with the peaceful shores of Lake Maggiore. A law dating back to 1990 recognizes five historical languages in the region, in addition to Italian. Barolo and the sparkling Asti are among the wines produced in Piemonte’s fertile hills.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Liguria>Liguria</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Genova</p><p>Portofino and the Cinque Terre are some of the most recognizable tourist spots in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liguria</a> — if not all of Italy. This coastal region stretches like an eyebrow along the Ligurian Sea. Another highlight is Genova, the capital city, which lends its name to both the pesto alla genovese and the professional football club Genoa.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Lombardia>Lombardia</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Milano</p><p>Apart from hosting Fashion Week, the Lombardia region (Lombardy in English) features some of the most scenic places in Italy. You can lose yourself in the central Alps while hiking in the lush Val Camonica and Valtellina. Lakes are a common sight across the region too, including Lake Garda, Lake Maggiore and the majestic Lake Como. Lombardia is the economic powerhouse of Italy and is considered one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Four Motors of Europe</a>. The region also counts the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highest number of UNESCO sites</a> (11) in all of Italy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Trentino-Alto-Adige>Trentino Alto Adige</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Trento</p><p>This <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">region</a> was annexed by Italy in 1919, following the country’s victory over the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the First World War. One of its two provinces, Bolzano, is a trilingual area, where German and Italian are official languages and Ladin is also spoken. The Bolzano province is also known as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">South Tyrol</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Veneto>Veneto</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Venezia</p><p>Divided among Alpine peaks, the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Veneto</a> region bursts with history and culture. From the iconic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venetian Carnival</a> to enviable examples of architecture — and from striking ski slopes to exquisite culinary traditions — this region never fails to impress. It’s also the birthplace of several artists (e.g. Vivaldi), painters (e.g. Tiepolo, Canaletto), writers (e.g. Goldoni) and explorers (e.g. Marco Polo).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Friuli-Venezia-Giulia>Friuli-Venezia Giulia</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Trieste</p><p>At the easternmost point of Northern Italy sits <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friuli-Venezia Giulia</a>. The territories of the Venezia Giulia, where Trieste is located, were lost after World War II and returned to Italy only in 1954. Due to its close proximity with Slovenia, Slovenian can often be heard in the eastern parts of the region. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barcolana</a>, the largest sailing competition in the world, takes place in the waters of Trieste.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Emilia-Romagna>Emilia Romagna</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Bologna</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This territory</a> merges two historical regions: Emilia (in the west) and Romagna (on the Adriatic coast). The capital of Bologna is home to what is considered the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">oldest university of the Western world</a>, which has been in operation for nearly a millennium. Among the region’s most famous culinary exports are Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, mortadella sausage and Parma ham.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Toscana>Toscana</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Firenze</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Toscana</a>’s capital city has the vibe of an open-air museum. However, the charm of the region also derives from its hilly and romantic landscapes, perfect for a stroll among vineyards and medieval towns. Toscana (Tuscany in English) is also the birthplace of some of the highest representatives of Italian literature and its language. The Toscano lays at the foundation of Italian as you know it today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Marche>Marche</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Ancona</p><p>Maria Montessori, known for her didactic approach to education, was born in this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hilly region</a> on the Adriatic Sea. Its territory is highly seismic, with nearly 94% of it considered at high risk of earthquake damage. On the plus side, all that seismic activity has led to numerous impressive caves sites; the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frasassi Caves</a> are among the most extensive cave networks in Europe.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Umbria>Umbria</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Perugia</p><p>At the heart of central Italy, this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">region</a> nests in the Appennino. Its landscapes are, for the most part, hilly. One of the most influential saints of the Catholic Church, St. Francis, was born in the Umbrian city of Assisi.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Fun fact: </strong>in 2004, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an asteroid</a> was named after the region.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Abruzzo->Abruzzo&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> L’Aquila</p><p>Despite sitting in the center of the country, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abruzzo</a> is considered part of Southern Italy. The region’s capital city is sadly famous for the 2009 earthquake (5.9 on the Richter scale) which razed large swathes of the urban landscape. On a happier note, Abruzzo is also home to three national parks, earning it a reputation as one of Europe’s greenest regions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Lazio>Lazio</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Roma</p><p>On the southern border of Tuscany lies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lazio</a>. It shares its territory with a tiny enclave that goes by the name of Vatican City. Lazio’s most recognizable city, Rome, is the region’s capital as well as the capital of the entire country. Cinecittà, a film studio in Rome, is the largest of its kind in Europe; filmmakers of the caliber of Fellini, Rossellini, Leone and Scorsese have all worked at the location.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Molise>Molise</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Campobasso</p><p>Another highly seismic region, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Molise</a> is also the least-populated territory of the country. It is also relatively young compared to the rest of the regions in Italy; it was officially recognized only in 1964, after detaching from a historic conglomerate that included Abruzzo, too.</p><p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: the meridian that designates the time zone in which Italy sits passes through this region and is known as the Termoli-Etna meridian.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Campania>Campania</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Napoli</p><p>After Lombardia, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Campania</a> is the second Italian region famous for its UNESCO sites and heritages. These include the Mediterranean diet, Pompei and the Amalfi Coast, among others. The region’s capital, Napoli (Naples in English), is known worldwide as the birthplace of pizza and features a stunning backdrop of the active volcano at Vesuvius. Campania is also home to seven islands. The region’s language, the Napolitano, has no official status in Italy but served as a co-official language (next to Latin) during the Kingdom of Naples.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Basilicata>Basilicata</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Potenza</p><p>The region is also known as Lucania and its inhabitants are referred to as lucani. Its territory sits at the very south of Italy, wedged between the heel of Puglia and the boot tip that is Calabria. Despite the topographical richness of the territory, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Basilicata</a> remains one of the least developed regions in the country. Matera, also known as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">City of Stones</a>, was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">European Capital of Culture</a> in 2014.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Puglia>Puglia</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Bari</p><p>Separated from Southeastern Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, this strip of land has been home to plenty of cultures, including the ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Spanish. Thanks to this long historical record, it is now the Italian region with the most archeological sites. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Puglia</a>’s breathtaking coastline is the longest in Italy. Agriculture plays a critical role in the region’s economy, and Puglia accounts for nearly 40% of the country’s olive oil production.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Calabria>Calabria</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Catanzaro</p><p>In this southern region, there are records of some of the most ancient human settlements in Italy. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Calabria</a> is also a center of interest for linguists since three ethnolinguistic minorities cohabit the territory: the Griko people, the Arbëreshë people and some Occitans. These minorities speak, respectively, a variant of Greek, Arbëresh (a language derived from a dialect spoken in southern Albania) and the Occitan language.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Sicilia>Sicilia</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Palermo</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sicily</a> is the biggest Italian island in the Mediterranean, but that’s not the region’s only claim to fame. A land that underwent many conquests, from the Greeks to the Catalans to the Arabs, Sicily reflects its history in a majestic fashion, through a kaleidoscope of architecture, products and language. Etna, the volcano overlooking Catania, is one of the tallest active volcanoes in Europe.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Sardegna>Sardegna</h2><p><strong>Capoluogo:</strong> Cagliari</p><p>The second Italian island reigning over the Mediterranean also had a variegated past of conquests. Its territory includes pristine coastlines, a rougher inland and a range of several different ecosystems. Different languages coexist in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sardegna</a>, from Italian to the historic Sardo to an archaic variation of Catalan spoken in Alghero. The island emblem is a white flag with a red cross and four bandaged heads (the “Four Moors”) facing opposite from the hoist.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Discover the regions of Italy on your own</h2><p>Squeezing the most relevant facts about Italy’s 20 regions into a single guide is a nearly impossible task. But we hope to have sparked your interest in learning more about each of these territories and their lush culture. If you embark on a journey, physical or digital, across the 20 regions of Italy, you’ll soon understand that each exists in its own historic and cultural lane. These lanes, of course, merge into the incredible patchwork that is Italy, but they never lose their own recognizable identity.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Valentina.jpg><h2>Valentina Rampazzo</h2><p><a href=#>Valentina Rampazzo</a> is an Italian Content Manager and writer.
