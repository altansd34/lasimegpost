However, her life took a&nbsp;different turn as&nbsp;she now enjoys a&nbsp;blissful household with her girlfriend, their newborn baby, and her now ex-husband who acted as&nbsp;their sperm donor.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new addition to&nbsp;the beautiful unconventional family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e9d/acb/fbcaeb5ae299eeb8794397fe57.png><p>The renowned blogger <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Linda Fruits</a> and her girlfriend Maddy has recently joyfully welcomed their son, Arlo. “Maddy woke me&nbsp;up&nbsp;at&nbsp;3:00 a.m. saying she thought her water broke. We&nbsp;quickly showered and headed to&nbsp;the hospital and by&nbsp;6:03 p.m.&nbsp;we&nbsp;had our beautiful boy, Arlo&nbsp;— all 6.8&nbsp;lbs. and 19&nbsp;inches of&nbsp;him... I&nbsp;was just so&nbsp;pleased he&nbsp;was here and Maddy was okay,” Linda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p>“Watching Maddy give birth (and being on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the bed) was absolutely incredible,” the happy mom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>. “My&nbsp;eyes were flooded with tears of&nbsp;love, joy and relief. The whole birthing process can either strengthen a&nbsp;bond, or&nbsp;break one, and&nbsp;I have never been more in&nbsp;love with her than I&nbsp;am this very moment.”</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, Linda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> that her former spouse is<strong>&nbsp;</strong>“delighted” to&nbsp;have “another boy” in&nbsp;their household, and their sons Elliot and Owen eagerly anticipate meeting their new sibling.</p><p><h2>Linda loved her husband but she needed more.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f1/6f2/f135cd5329b923c11a8eb15043.jpg><p>During her marriage, Linda, 33, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that although she appeared to&nbsp;have everything she desired, something was amiss. “I&nbsp;was still missing something,” she admitted. “I&nbsp;just wasn’t really aware of&nbsp;what it&nbsp;was yet.”</p><p>Linda and her husband, Chris Haerting, 37, had been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> since 2016 and had been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> for several years prior. They first met at&nbsp;the bar where Linda worked, eventually becoming best friends, tying the knot, and starting a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> with their three and five-year-old <a href=# title=children data-link=tag>children</a>.</p><p>However, despite their connection, Linda couldn’t find the desired intimacy within their relationship. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> it&nbsp;as&nbsp;feeling obligatory. In&nbsp;fact, she even confided in&nbsp;her best friend, questioning whether an&nbsp;open marriage was necessary because she struggled to&nbsp;engage intimately with her husband.</p><p><h2>She found out what was actually missing in&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7e9/acf/f0ed1f514892b23b14eee9ffa3.png><p>As&nbsp;their children began attending daycare, Linda, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young mother, finally had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;breath and truly reflect on&nbsp;her own feelings. It&nbsp;was during this time that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stumbled</a> upon “lesbian TikTok” and found herself unexpectedly drawn to&nbsp;the content created by&nbsp;sapphic individuals.</p><p>After extensive introspection, Linda made the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decision</a> to&nbsp;come out to&nbsp;her husband. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “No&nbsp;person should go&nbsp;this long without wanting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;held or&nbsp;kissed or&nbsp;touched,” Linda says. “And I&nbsp;wanted him to&nbsp;have what he&nbsp;deserves.”</p><p><h2>To&nbsp;express her truth to&nbsp;her husband was a&nbsp;daunting task.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9e6/121/370eb85e66b6a8708c9bde5270.png><p>“I&nbsp;loved our family and&nbsp;I didn’t want anything to&nbsp;change,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, which is&nbsp;why she found herself overcome with uncontrollable sobs as&nbsp;she broke the news to&nbsp;Chris while he&nbsp;was stepping out of&nbsp;the shower. Thankfully, he&nbsp;received Linda’s revelation with understanding and compassion. “I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;around gay and lesbian people. My&nbsp;parents had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;friends that had come out late in&nbsp;life,” Chris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>. “It&nbsp;all made sense.”</p><p>As&nbsp;they navigate the process of&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>, the couple naturally decided to&nbsp;conclude their romantic partnership. However, they found themselves confronted with questions: “What do&nbsp;we&nbsp;do&nbsp;now? Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;get divorced? Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;separate our assets? Do&nbsp;we&nbsp;split up&nbsp;our children? ... That’s what everybody does, right?” Chris <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>, reflecting on&nbsp;that significant moment.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new arrangement took place in&nbsp;their household, as&nbsp;they both started dating new people.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/861/f9b/89907b570ea8deb59c17c7cc60.png><p>Due to&nbsp;their strong co-parenting dynamic and close bond, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made the decision</a> to&nbsp;continue living together in&nbsp;their shared home even after their separation in&nbsp;August 2021. “We&nbsp;work well day-to-day,” said Chris, who is&nbsp;the owner of&nbsp;two businesses. “We&nbsp;love waking up&nbsp;with our kids in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=morning data-link=tag>morning</a> and taking care of&nbsp;them together.”</p><p>They reorganized their living arrangements within the house, occupying separate sides, and eventually started exploring new romantic connections. Chris began dating before Linda, while she took her time. When she downloaded a&nbsp;dating app for lesbians, her intention was not to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;serious relationship. She simply wanted to&nbsp;embrace and understand this newly discovered aspect of&nbsp;herself. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “I&nbsp;was by&nbsp;no&nbsp;means looking to&nbsp;meet someone and fall head over heels in&nbsp;love with them.”</p><p>However, to&nbsp;her <a href=# title=surprise data-link=tag>surprise</a>, love found its way into her life. After a&nbsp;disappointing first date due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;chemistry, she arranged to&nbsp;meet Maddy, a&nbsp;36-year-old E.R. physician’s assistant. Linda shares, “There wasn’t a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pre-communication.” She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “Just like, ’Hey, let’s meet&nbsp;up. Okay, great. See you there.’”</p><p><h2>After Linda found her new female partner, the three together decided to&nbsp;expand their interconnected family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/660/3a2/d930c956d7902aaf1e77e297d5.png><p>Their axe-throwing date turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;resounding success. Both women quickly developed deep feelings for each other, and within the first few weeks, Maddy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> her love for Linda. Although there was a&nbsp;lot for Maddy to&nbsp;process when she learned about Linda’s unique living arrangement, it&nbsp;didn’t alter her emotions.</p><p>During their second date, Maddy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made a&nbsp;confession</a> of&nbsp;her own. She revealed her longstanding dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother and her pursuit of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sperm donor to&nbsp;fulfill that desire. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;playful manner, Linda jokingly responded, “Great, you can have one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids.”</p><p>However, as&nbsp;Linda observed Maddy’s natural affinity with her children, she began contemplating the possibility of&nbsp;asking Chris if&nbsp;he&nbsp;would consider being a&nbsp;sperm donor to&nbsp;help Maddy achieve her goal. Several months later, Linda finally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posed the question</a> to&nbsp;Chris, and he&nbsp;agreed. However, he&nbsp;made it&nbsp;clear that he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;“silent donor.” He&nbsp;expressed his intention to&nbsp;actively participate in&nbsp;raising the child, assuming the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;live-in father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d2f/b6e/20ae5958b7b84ef1adad4ed996.png><p>After several attempts, Maddy successfully <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became pregnant</a> using an&nbsp;at-home insemination kit, bringing excitement and anticipation to&nbsp;the three adults who now reside together.</p><p>They began preparing for their new life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;parental trio, affectionately referred to&nbsp;by&nbsp;Linda as ’<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Fruity Bunch</a>,’ symbolizing their growing and interconnected family.</p><p><h2>Explaining their unique living arrangement to&nbsp;their 2&nbsp;sons went on&nbsp;smoothly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/38f/e9a/a61dbf53dca86d6b4a952d4f15.png><p>When it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;explaining their unique living arrangement to&nbsp;their two sons, Linda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that her oldest child was unfazed by&nbsp;the fact that “mommy and daddy don’t share the same bed.”</p><p>At&nbsp;one point, when he&nbsp;questioned why Maddy was still living with them, Linda took the opportunity to&nbsp;highlight how fortunate they were. She explained that some children have only one parent who loves them at&nbsp;home. Others have two. But they are incredibly lucky to&nbsp;have three parents who are here to&nbsp;care for them.</p><p>Linda also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> to&nbsp;him, “It&nbsp;makes Mommy a&nbsp;better person, and it&nbsp;makes Papa a&nbsp;better person. Maddy helps&nbsp;us be&nbsp;happier.” Following this heartfelt conversation, her son never asked that question again. It&nbsp;was as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;truly grasped and understood the dynamics of&nbsp;their unique family structure.</p><p><h2>The internet’s reaction to&nbsp;Maddy’s pregnancy is&nbsp;divided.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ad4/307/9c467653cb9abea3169856b1bb.png><p>Later, Linda publicly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a> Maddy’s pregnancy on&nbsp;her blog. While they received an&nbsp;outpouring of&nbsp;support, they also faced <a href=# title=criticism data-link=tag>criticism</a> from those who disapprove of&nbsp;their unconventional family arrangement. “It&nbsp;confuses a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people,” acknowledged Chris, while Linda added that some people think it’s narcissistic. However, they have also encountered individuals who have experienced divorces and expressed how much they appreciate and admire the positive impact their arrangement has on&nbsp;the children.</p><p>Despite the challenges they face and the need to&nbsp;adapt to&nbsp;unforeseen obstacles, the three parents rely on&nbsp;a&nbsp;shared Google Calendar and, above all, an&nbsp;abundance of&nbsp;love and dedication to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;harmonious household. Linda <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> their commitment to&nbsp;continuously find solutions and what works best for everyone involved, saying, “We’ll just keep figuring it&nbsp;out as&nbsp;we&nbsp;go, what works best for all of&nbsp;us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d2a/2e6/34612f51029122cd345750cebb.jpg><p>This extraordinary modern blended family serves as&nbsp;evidence that it’s <a href=#>not always</a> necessary to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;conventional methods in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;happy functional family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSwucCnZLCdnJi8rrHSZpmamqlixKrAx2aeoqqcm7%2Bqsc2dZJ6wXZ3CtK7Ap5tmoaNiwamxyKtkrKiVp7pusM6npqtlaGaAdYOQaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./agt-winners-the-mayyas-stun-on-stage-with-beyonce-in-dubai.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'AGT' Winners The Mayyas Stun On Stage With Beyonce in Dubai">&larr;
