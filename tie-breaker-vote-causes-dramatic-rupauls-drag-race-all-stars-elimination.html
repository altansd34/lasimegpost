The drama came in the form of a tiebreaker vote that nobody saw coming. Wigs were flying and shade was thrown in the challenge that required the queens to flaunt their rap skills.</strong> <strong>Was anyone else not prepared for that crazy elimination?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trinity-k-bonet-emerges-as-the-front-runner-during-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars-rap-challenge>Trinity K. Bonet Emerges as the Front-Runner During ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars’ Rap Challenge</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>The queens</a> had to write lyrics to entertain, inspire, and teach the children what they stand for. The lyrics were all to be performed to the song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Show Up Queen.”</a> They were sorted into two teams and had to come up with their own choreography. What could go wrong?&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kylie Sonique Love</a>, Ginger Minj, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eureka&nbsp;O’Hara</a> were put onto one team. Ra’Jah O’Hara, Trinity K. Bonet, Jan, and Pandora&nbsp;Boxx were on the other team. The most important part of this challenge was to make sure that the lyrics had a message. Jan missed the mark a bit when she wrote lyrics about being peppy and energetic all of the time. It didn’t really compare to the other’s who poured their hearts out.</p><p>Pandora’s lyrics were about how she was “afraid to speak” growing up because she was trying to hide a certain part of herself. She wanted to “give a voice to the voiceless.” Her lyrics were very deep, but fans of the show know that Pandora isn’t exactly known for her dancing. When it came time for the performance, all of the other queens were giving it so much energy while she struggled to nail the moves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The best part of the episode is Ginger wearing a hot pink jumpsuit to camouflage with the wallpaper and spy on the other team. Another highlight of the episode is obviously the fact that Trinity completely slayed the challenge. She wanted to teach the youth about HIV&nbsp;through her lyrics. It was powerful, well-written, and inspiring.</p><p>Trinity totally crushed her performance and so did Ra’Jah. During the “Hot Tropics” runway challenge, Trinity came out in a Carnival inspired feathered outfit that stole the show. She really won all of the judges over. It was obvious that Trinity was the clear winner of the challenge after basically owning the week. With two challenge wins under her belt, she is without question the front-runner in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-an-accidental-wig-reveal-sets-up-the-most-dramatic-vote-of-the-season>An Accidental Wig Reveal Sets Up the Most Dramatic Vote of the Season</h2><p>Pandora and Jan were named as the bottom two this week. Pandora faded into the background surrounded by so many strong dancers and personalities. Jan’s lyrics really did not resonate with the judges and they felt like it “lacked soul.” Their fate lied in Trinity and the rest of the group to decide which of them was going home.</p><p>Alexis Mateo&nbsp;was revealed to be the lip-sync assassin this week. Alexis and Trinity performed a lip-sync to “Dance Again” by Jennifer Lopez. It felt like Trinity was going to win, until her wig pretty much decided to fly off her head. She handled it like a pro and continued to dance with her wig hanging on to her back. Alexis won the lip-sync with a sparkly costume reveal. She revealed that the group voted out Pandora…or so we thought.</p><p>Alexis pulled a second lipstick out of her bra with Jan’s name on it. The queens votes actually ended up in a tie. RuPaul told the queens that in the event of a tie, the power goes back to the top all star of the week. Trinity uttered “this some bullshit here” before having to make the final decision. In a very emotional moment, Trinity sent Jan home. RuPaul’s face looked completely shook along with Jan’s.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Jan ended up breaking down crying after hearing Trinity’s decision. You could totally tell it wasn’t an easy decision for Trinity to make but she did what had to be done. Trinity told Jan before she left how much she inspires her. TKB does have feelings after all! All hope isn’t lost for Jan though since there is a twist coming up for the eliminated queens. RuPaul is being pretty sneaky by not revealing any further details.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/159286_9360.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Winner Chayce Beckham Opens for Country Star Dustin Lynch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706KcZpqimq6ssdFmraislWKwosHSnqpmnKKWuqLAyJxkq62glsKtv4ydqZqfXaeupLGMmqOlZaOprrO%2FjJ6joqWZo661tc6nZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./vanessa-hudgens-just-married-cole-tucker-photos-and-details-from-her-jungle-wedding-816808.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Hudgens Just MARRIED Cole Tucker, Photos and Details From Her Jungle Wedding">&larr;
