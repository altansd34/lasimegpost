Not so many boxers start their careers with such an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">impressive record</a>. Thus, it was clear that Vasyl was destined for greatness in the future. Here is a glimpse at some of Vasyl Lomachenko highlights in his amateur career.</p><ul><li>He began his amateur career at the 2007 World Championships in Chicago with a fight against Abner Cotto. It was a successful debut as he won the fight in the first round. He went on to defeat other contestants such as Theodoros Papazov, Arturo Santos Reyes, and Li Yang, thereby setting up a final bout against Albert Selimov, a Russian boxer. Unfortunately, he was defeated in the last event.</li><li>He had his day for revenge with Selimov at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. That tournament was prosperous for him, as he went on to win gold as well as to receive the coveted ‘Val Barker Trophy’ as the most impressive boxer at the event.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cb91345e69b0a8a5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sibi Blažić’s biography: what is known about Christian Bale’s wife?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0b01b7b590184669.jpg><ul><li>His top form went on at the 2008 European Champions, where he defeated every opponent he faced.</li><li>In 2009, he won the featherweight division title at the World Championships. He outclassed all his opponents at the tournament.</li><li>In 2011, at the World Championships tournament, he was at his best form. Once again, he beat all the six opponents. He took the gold medal of the lightweight division.</li><li>2012 London Olympics was not different from the other tournaments as he bagged a second gold medal when he beat Han Soon-Chul, a South Korean boxer.</li></ul><h2>Professional career</h2><p class=align-left>After a successful spell in the amateur division, it was soon time to graduate to the professional class. So far, he has had an exemplary winning streak in pro boxing. He has won 14 bouts, whereby 10 of them came via knockout. He has lost only one fight. Here is a sneak peek of some of the defining moments of his pro career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f5bf2efc62ed255c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jujimufu biography: age, height, wife, net worth, steroids</span></p></a><ul><li>He stepped into the big stage of professional boxing by signing a contract with Top Rank. He started his professional boxing career on the right note by beating Jose Ramirez via knockout on October 12, 2013, in Nevada. This was a non-title fight.</li><li>After the win, he dared to challenge for a title while trying to make a world record. His dream of taking the WBO featherweight title was shattered when Orlando Salido defeated him on March 1, 2014, in San Antonio, Texas.</li><li>It did take long before he went back to his winning ways when he beat Gary Russell Jr, winning the WBO featherweight champion on June 22, 2014. The fight was organized after Salido lost the title.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6bfe08719349bcc5.png><ul><li>As the WBO featherweight titleholder, he had to defend it against a mandatory opponent who was Chonlatarn Piriyapinyo, a Thai boxer. The fight was at Cotai Arena, Venetian Resort, in Macao on November 22, 2014. It was a highly competitive fight, and even though he got a win, his left hand was injured.</li><li>The victory in the mandatory challenge gave him the chance to face Gamalier Rodriguez, who, at that time, was enjoying a 17 bout winning streak. At the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 2, 2015, he dominated every round of the fight, ultimately taking down Rodriguez in the 9th round via a TKO.</li><li>His next opponent was Romulo Koasicha, a Mexican. The contest was organized at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Paradise, Nevada, on November 7, 2015. It was easy and deservedly won for Vasyl as he retained his featherweight title.</li><li>It was now time to seek significant challenges, and he had his eyes on the super-featherweight division. The titleholder was Roman ‘Rocky’ Martinez. The fight was organized on June 11, 2016. He outpaced and outclassed Rocky in every aspect of the bout until he knocked him out on the fifth round. On that day, history was made as he became the fastest boxer to win a world title in two weight categories.</li><li>Nicholas Walters, a Jamaican boxer, was up next as his opponent for a super-featherweight title defense at The Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas, on November 26, 2016. The fight was concluded on the seventh round when he knocked out the boxer.</li><li>WBA ‘Regular’ champion Jason Sosa’s attempt on Vasyl super-featherweight title was thwarted on April 8, 2017, when Vasyl Lomachenko saw him off in the ninth round. The fight took place at the MGM National Harbor in Washington D.C.</li><li>He had a third successful defense of his WBO title against Miguel Marriaga at the Microsoft Theather in Los Angeles on August 5, 2017. In the fight, his opponent retired in the seventh round.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/03192dec347f9dfb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lola Alao: Most exciting details about the renowned actress</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cb91345e69b0a8a5.jpg><ul><li>In December 2017, Lomachenko retained his title after he knocked out Cuban boxer, Guillermo Rigondeaux.</li><li>The super-featherweight division seemed not a challenge for him. He opted to move to the lightweight division where his first opponent was Jorge Linares, the titleholder at Madison Square, New York City, on May 12, 2018. It was a hotly contested fight in which Lomachenko had to overcome a sixth-round scare knockdown to win the battle knocking out his opponent on the 10th round. He claimed the WBA (Super) and ‘The Ring’ lightweight titles.</li><li>A unification title fight between Lomachenko and Pedraza was slated on December 8, 2018, at the Hulu Theatre, New York City. On the fight day, he beat his opponent via unanimous decision retaining the WBA (Super) title and claiming the WBO lightweight title.</li><li>His next fight would be against Crolla at the Staples Center, Los Angeles, California, on April 12, 2019. Lomachenko was the superior contender in the contest as he controlled the tempo of the fight. By the fourth round, he knocked out Crolla. He successfully defended his WBA (Super), WBO, and ‘The Ring’ lightweight titles.</li><li>Vasyl Lomachenko's last fight was on August 31, 2019, against Campbell. He retained his WBA, WBO, and ‘The Ring” lightweight titles. He also received the vacant WBC lightweight title.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b9beff555c0a88d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gad Elmaleh biography: Partners, son, religion, net worth, movies</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5cf230bb74ce5888.jpg><h2>Vasyl Lomachenko net worth</h2><p class=align-left>How rich could he be?
