However, there is&nbsp;only one woman who knew him when the surname Mercury was still unknown. She was also the one who stayed by&nbsp;his side when his illness defeated him. Mary Austin was Freddie Mercury’s common-law wife and his <a href=#>only friend</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;the band <a href=# title=Queen data-link=tag>Queen</a> and of&nbsp;Freddie Mercury’s music. We’re also suckers for a&nbsp;good romantic story. So&nbsp;today we’re dedicating our article to&nbsp;the <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> and deep <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> between a&nbsp;simple girl and a&nbsp;world famous musician.</p><p><h2>The beginning</h2></p><p>Mary Austin and Freddie Mercury met each other thanks to&nbsp;their love for beautiful clothing. Mary was working at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=London data-link=tag>London</a> clothing store called Biba, while Freddie was <a href=#>selling</a> vintage clothing at&nbsp;Kensington Market together with his friend Roger Taylor (Queen’s drummer). At&nbsp;that time, the name Freddie Mercury didn’t mean anything to&nbsp;most people and there was one more year left until Queen even made a&nbsp;blip on&nbsp;the radar.</p><p>Mary Austin was born into a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;deaf and mute people and communicated with her parents with the help of&nbsp;sign language. In&nbsp;other ways, this family wasn’t much different from any other family. Her father was a&nbsp;plasterer and her mother was a&nbsp;maid. This small and fragile girl attracted the future rock idol’s attention instantly. However, Mary herself was a&nbsp;little shocked because Freddie was always wearing bright and shocking clothing and this time was no&nbsp;exception. She saw a&nbsp;24-year-old long-haired badass in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shocking outfit, which of&nbsp;course, made her feel a&nbsp;little insecure and embarrassed.</p><p>Mary remembers that they were as&nbsp;poor as&nbsp;church mice during those times and their romance was similar to&nbsp;the relationship of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;other couples. They would listen to&nbsp;music and take long walks, but they couldn’t afford much else. It&nbsp;was pretty difficult for musicians who were trying to&nbsp;break into the music scene in&nbsp;London in&nbsp;the 1970s because there were thousands of&nbsp;other musicians like them.</p><p><h2>The way to&nbsp;fame</h2></p><p class=adme-img-description>Queen in&nbsp;1974</p><p>After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months of&nbsp;dating, the young couple started living together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny apartment. Soon after that, Queen, the legendary band that would soon conquer the whole world, appeared. However, at&nbsp;that moment no&nbsp;one was aware of&nbsp;this, so&nbsp;the couple led a&nbsp;relatively simple life. Freddie wrote songs, while Mary supported him.</p><p>Queen released their first album in&nbsp;1973. It&nbsp;was then that their life started to&nbsp;change and shortly they were able to&nbsp;afford an&nbsp;apartment in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very prestigious district of&nbsp;London. That’s when Freddie Mercury wrote the ballad <a href=#>Love of&nbsp;My&nbsp;Life</a>, dedicated it&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mary, and proposed to&nbsp;her. The proposal was done with the sense of&nbsp;humor that Mercury has always had.</p><p>Then, when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;23, he&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;big box on&nbsp;Christmas Day. Inside was another box, then another, and so&nbsp;it&nbsp;went&nbsp;on. It&nbsp;was like one of&nbsp;his playful games. Eventually, I&nbsp;found a&nbsp;lovely jade ring inside the last small box. I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;it&nbsp;and was speechless. I&nbsp;remember thinking, I&nbsp;don’t understand what’s going&nbsp;on. It&nbsp;wasn’t what I’d expected at&nbsp;all. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;asked him, “Which hand should&nbsp;I put this&nbsp;on?” And he&nbsp;said, “Ring finger, left hand.” And then he&nbsp;said, “Because, will you marry&nbsp;me?” I&nbsp;was shocked. It&nbsp;just so&nbsp;wasn’t what&nbsp;I was expecting. I&nbsp;just whispered, “Yes. I&nbsp;will.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/179/c68/fc20d95139aa6b659ffe757fd7.jpg><p>Freddie introduced his fiancée to&nbsp;his mother, Jer Bulsara, who was extremely <a href=#>delighted</a> with her son’s choice. She dreamed that the couple would get married and have children. However, the wedding didn’t happen. The engagement lasted for 3&nbsp;years and ended up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;breakup.</p><p>After the band’s first album, they released 2&nbsp;more with one year in&nbsp;between. Queen was becoming hugely popular, Freddie was gaining many new fans and Mary started to&nbsp;feel odd in&nbsp;Freddie’s new world.</p><p>“Sometime later,” she says. “I&nbsp;spotted a&nbsp;wonderful antique wedding dress in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small shop. And as&nbsp;Freddie hadn’t said anything more about marrying, the only way that&nbsp;I could test the water was to&nbsp;say, ’Is it&nbsp;time&nbsp;I bought the dress?’ But he&nbsp;said&nbsp;no. He&nbsp;had gone off the idea and it&nbsp;never happened. I&nbsp;was disappointed. Things were getting very complicated and the atmosphere between&nbsp;us was changing a&nbsp;lot.”</p><p><h2>Living separately</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/29e/775/c76c6d5a148853363ea245f499.jpg><p>Freddie had started to&nbsp;come home late and their relationship was fading. After some time he&nbsp;<a href=#>confessed</a> to&nbsp;Mary about his non-traditional sexual orientation. Mary recalls that they tried to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;frank with each other and avoided arguments. Their love story ended, but the friendship and platonic love between this great rock star and this simple girl became lifelong.</p><p>After the breakup, Mercury managed to&nbsp;persuade Mary to&nbsp;not leave him and she settled into a&nbsp;place a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;steps from where he&nbsp;lived. She was always beside him working as&nbsp;an&nbsp;assistant and accompanying him to&nbsp;concerts and on&nbsp;his tours.</p><p>"I&nbsp;met Mary in&nbsp;1970 and we&nbsp;have had a&nbsp;warm relationship since then. I’ve never been as&nbsp;close to&nbsp;anyone else as&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;her. We’ve lived together for 7&nbsp;years and&nbsp;I still love her. Love is&nbsp;something that is&nbsp;the hardest to&nbsp;reach and it&nbsp;can disappoint harshly like nothing else can. Mary and&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;strong bond that has grown even stronger over the years. She has gone through many things and has always stayed by&nbsp;my&nbsp;side.’</p><p>Mary Austin had her own personal life just like Freddie Mercury. Mary gave birth to&nbsp;2&nbsp;children but didn’t marry their father. Freddie Mercury became the <a href=#>godfather</a> to&nbsp;Mary’s oldest son. At&nbsp;that time, Freddie was desperately looking for love, he&nbsp;was surrounded by&nbsp;crowds of&nbsp;fans but he&nbsp;always approached Mary when looking for warmth and support.</p><p>“All my&nbsp;lovers asked me&nbsp;why they couldn’t replace Mary, but it’s simply impossible. The only friend I’ve got is&nbsp;Mary, and&nbsp;I don’t want anybody else. To&nbsp;me, she was my&nbsp;common-law wife. To&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;marriage. We&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;each other. That’s enough for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;couldn’t fall in&nbsp;love with a&nbsp;man the same way as&nbsp;I have with Mary.”</p><p><h2>The illness and the end of&nbsp;the story</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/848/2a7/4025d25188ab4356eae1ccff68.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, there were only 2&nbsp;people who knew that Freddie Mercury was HIV positive&nbsp;— Mary Austin and Jim Hutton. When the illness had almost defeated the singer, these 2&nbsp;people were always there beside him. Mary was his lifelong and faithful friend, while Jim was the last lover of&nbsp;the great singer.</p><p>Hutton himself lived for 20&nbsp;years after being infected with HIV and died in&nbsp;2010 from lung cancer.</p><p>In&nbsp;1991, Mercury lost his eyesight and was almost bedridden. He&nbsp;<a href=#>stopped</a> taking his pills and refused to&nbsp;fight for his life. Mary and Jim were there with him&nbsp;— they were reflecting on&nbsp;old times, watching recordings of&nbsp;Queen concerts, laughing, and crying together.</p><p>“Ours is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pure friendship but a&nbsp;friendship of&nbsp;the highest standard. It’s an&nbsp;instinctive thing. I&nbsp;still love her. We’ll probably grow old together.”</p><p><h2>Inheritance and funeral</h2></p><p>Freddie Mercury passed away on&nbsp;the 24th of&nbsp;November, 1991. Before his death, Freddie made a&nbsp;will where he&nbsp;gave the biggest part of&nbsp;his income (present and future) and his huge mansion, <a href=#>Garden Lodge</a> in&nbsp;London, to&nbsp;Mary Austin.</p><p>“You could become my&nbsp;wife and you would get all this [inheritance] anyway.”</p><p>Mary Austin said that Mercury’s friends and colleagues turned their back on&nbsp;her once they learned that Freddie had left the biggest part of&nbsp;his money to&nbsp;her. She felt completely alone after her friend’s death and had to&nbsp;fight with tax authorities for a&nbsp;pretty long time because they were threatening to&nbsp;take Mercury’s mansion away.</p><p>Another important point of&nbsp;Mercury’s will was his funeral. The singer wanted for Mary Austin to&nbsp;spread his ashes and keep the place she did it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret. Mercury was afraid that strange people would assemble at&nbsp;his grave and he&nbsp;didn’t want anyone to&nbsp;defile his final resting place.</p><p>Mary kept the urn with Mercury’s ashes for 2&nbsp;years and then spread them. She fulfilled Freddie’s request&nbsp;— no&nbsp;one in&nbsp;this world knows where the ashes of&nbsp;the great Freddie Mercury are.</p><p>“I&nbsp;never betrayed Freddie in&nbsp;his lifetime. And I’ll never betray him now.”</p><p>Queen fans have several theories about&nbsp;it. The first one says that Mary took the singer’s ashes to&nbsp;his motherland, in&nbsp;Zanzibar. The second theory says that Freddie’s last resting place is&nbsp;in&nbsp;his favorite garden at&nbsp;his mansion, Garden Lodge. The third one appeared when his <a href=#>fans recently found</a> a&nbsp;memorial plaque with the name Farrokh Bulsara, which is&nbsp;Mercury’s real name. Mary Austin hasn’t confirmed any of&nbsp;these theories.</p><p><h2>Today</h2></p><p>Mary Austin turned 67&nbsp;in&nbsp;2018. She lives in&nbsp;Mercury’s mansion behind inaccessible walls and doesn’t communicate with journalists. Mary <a href=#>refused</a> to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the shooting of&nbsp;Bohemian Rhapsody, but she read the script and approved&nbsp;it.</p><p>Queen’s fans don’t like Mary Austin very much. Freddie Mercury’s fans from all over the world go&nbsp;to&nbsp;London to&nbsp;visit his Garden Lodge mansion and leave flowers, paintings, and poems there in&nbsp;memory of&nbsp;the great musician. But Mary <a href=#>demanded</a> to&nbsp;have all of&nbsp;these signs removed from the fence and the door of&nbsp;the estate. The walls have since been covered with plexiglass and it’s become impossible to&nbsp;leave memorable presents since then.</p><p>However, Freddie Mercury’s mother and his sister Kasmira have always had <a href=#>a&nbsp;warm attitude</a> toward Mary and have always considered her a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the Bulsara family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d6/ed4/1494bc58259c44e39e39a153dd.jpg><p>Now you know a&nbsp;little more about Freddie and Mary’s relationship.
