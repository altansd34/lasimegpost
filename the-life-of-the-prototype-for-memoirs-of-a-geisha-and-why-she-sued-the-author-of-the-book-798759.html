But one of&nbsp;the topics that never stops being interesting is&nbsp;geishas. Their history, traditions, rules, and how they exist in&nbsp;modern society&nbsp;— all of&nbsp;these things are discussed, shown in&nbsp;films, and described in&nbsp;literature. The life of&nbsp;the most famous and highest-paid geisha, Mineko Iwasaki, was described in&nbsp;Arthur Golden’s novel <a href=#>Memoirs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geisha</a>, where Mineko was the prototype. The book was a&nbsp;huge hit, it&nbsp;sold millions of&nbsp;copies, and a&nbsp;movie was made based on&nbsp;it. But Mineko herself was horrified by&nbsp;the novel.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are really interested in&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;this unusual woman and we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;learn more about her life. Also, we&nbsp;found out why she had to&nbsp;file a&nbsp;lawsuit against Arthur Golden and write her own book, <a href=#>Geisha: A&nbsp;Life</a>.</p><p><h2>Mineko grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;low-income family and her fate was predetermined.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7a8/3f5/a3a4ce5664bf0036e4a9fd9b5a.png><p>The <a href=#>family</a> the future geisha was born into in&nbsp;1949 had not always been poor. Her father came from a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;aristocrats that went bankrupt. During the Meiji Restoration, Masako’s father’s ancestors didn’t want to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;Tokyo and lost all their titles and privileges. When their eleventh child was born (Masako), her father and mother had a&nbsp;small business. But it&nbsp;wasn’t enough to&nbsp;provide for the whole family and also help their relatives. Masako’s older sisters were given to&nbsp;a&nbsp;geisha house to&nbsp;earn some money and Masako had the same fate.</p><p>Believe it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not, giving away daughters like this wasn’t considered terrible to&nbsp;do&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=#>Japan</a>. It&nbsp;was honorable and parents would no&nbsp;longer have to&nbsp;worry about their children’s future.</p><p><h2>She started learning the secrets of&nbsp;geishas at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age</h2></p><p>While still young, Masako went to&nbsp;Kyoto, which had a&nbsp;special place for becoming a&nbsp;geisha called an&nbsp;okiya. The owner of&nbsp;the place noticed the girl right away. She thought she was very talented and gracious. Masako had many sisters that attended this school, but the teacher decided to&nbsp;adopt Masako, making her an&nbsp;heir. The parents agreed and the girl’s name and status changed: she became <strong>Mineko Iwasaki</strong>.</p><p><h2>Mineko’s talent made her famous, but in&nbsp;the beginning, she had a&nbsp;hard time because of&nbsp;the jealousy from other girls.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a2/2f5/c1ca595fdba35e538ce96a9876.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Memoirs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geisha, 2005</p><p>Mineko started studying hard. She <a href=#>loved</a> dancing more than anything and she was clearly very talented. But aside from that, she also needed to&nbsp;learn calligraphy, play traditional Japanese musical instruments, and master the <a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a> of&nbsp;conversation. Additionally, all of&nbsp;the girls were supposed to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;behave a&nbsp;certain way, take very specific care of&nbsp;their bodies, and develop new habits.</p><p>This is&nbsp;what Mineko revealed in&nbsp;her book, Geisha: A&nbsp;Life, about the <strong>everyday things she had to&nbsp;do</strong>:</p><p>“After becoming a&nbsp;maiko, I&nbsp;<a href=#>went</a> to&nbsp;the hairdresser once every 5&nbsp;days. To&nbsp;preserve the shape of&nbsp;their hairstyle, I&nbsp;slept on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rectangular lacquered wooden pillow topped with a&nbsp;wooden cushion. At&nbsp;first, the pillow kept me&nbsp;awake, but soon&nbsp;I got used to&nbsp;it. The okiya had a&nbsp;trick to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;us from removing the pillow during the night. The maids would sprinkle rice bran around the pillow. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl removed the pillow, bits of&nbsp;bran stuck like glue to&nbsp;the pomade in&nbsp;her hair, and the next morning she had to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;unhappy trip back to&nbsp;the hairdresser. <strong>After finishing at&nbsp;the hairdresser’s, I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the barbershop to&nbsp;have my&nbsp;face <a href=#>shaved</a></strong>, a&nbsp;common practice among Japanese women. My&nbsp;face was shaved for the first time by&nbsp;my&nbsp;father after he&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;my&nbsp;first haircut, on&nbsp;the day&nbsp;I turned 1&nbsp;year old.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e38/436/efe0c75991b48f7134baa1d121.jpg><p>Memoirs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geisha, 2005</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;become true geishas, girls were supposed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through several stages of&nbsp;learning. But Mineko was <a href=#>invited</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with guests when she wasn’t even an&nbsp;official student yet. <strong>She became the face of&nbsp;the school at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15</strong>&nbsp;and famous guests liked her the most. She was a&nbsp;great dancer and she was very good at&nbsp;holding conversations and entertaining guests. The word about this new star started spreading around the country.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, this affected Mineko’s relationship with other geishas. They were jealous and even dangerous: she was <a href=#>attacked</a> on&nbsp;the street. She was also the subject of&nbsp;conflict from the men she said no&nbsp;to.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make things better with the girls, Mineko <a href=#>took</a> them to&nbsp;receptions with her so&nbsp;they could earn good money too. But it&nbsp;didn’t help much&nbsp;— they were still very jealous.</p><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;29, she had to&nbsp;<a href=#>finish</a> her career because her <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> was in&nbsp;danger. Her working day started at&nbsp;7:30 a.m. and ended way past midnight. The rest of&nbsp;the time, she took care of&nbsp;herself, prepared for events, and learned. She only had <a href=#>3&nbsp;hours</a> a&nbsp;day for sleep. She had serious kidney problems. She realized it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;save herself. However, at&nbsp;the time, she was the highest-paid geisha in&nbsp;Japan, earning around <a href=#>$500,000&nbsp;a year</a>.</p><p><h2>She met a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;famous people, but the experiences were not always pleasant.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f38/d31/c4a1c9547997c1477aa79a5a9d.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Memoirs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geisha, 2005</p><p>In&nbsp;her book, Mineko talked about her encounters with famous people. She had to&nbsp;deal with different kinds of&nbsp;treatment, from prejudice to&nbsp;admiration. But one of&nbsp;the key skills of&nbsp;a&nbsp;geisha is&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;deal with awkward and uncomfortable situations.</p><p>Once, Mineko <a href=#>met</a> Aldo Gucci, the Italian fashion designer. He&nbsp;accidentally spilled soy sauce on&nbsp;her very expensive kimono and he&nbsp;was very embarrassed. In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;distract him, she asked Gucci to&nbsp;leave an&nbsp;autograph on&nbsp;her kimono, telling him it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;an&nbsp;honor for her. In&nbsp;reality, she didn’t care about the autograph and was only thinking that she would never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;wear it&nbsp;again. She was even planning to&nbsp;give the kimono to&nbsp;Gucci sometime later, but she never saw him again.</p><p>Another time, Mineko wanted to&nbsp;<a href=#>teach</a> <a href=# title="Queen Elizabeth" data-link=tag>Queen Elizabeth</a> a&nbsp;lesson after the royal didn’t touch the food that was prepared for her, even though it&nbsp;had been approved beforehand. Mineko went up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her husband and got him interested in&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation with her. It&nbsp;looked like a&nbsp;very personal conversation and the spouses later got into an&nbsp;argument about&nbsp;it.</p><p>She also <a href=#>met</a> Prince Charles. He&nbsp;asked Mineko to&nbsp;give him her fan. When she gave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;him, he&nbsp;signed it&nbsp;and gave it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;her. She loved that fan and he&nbsp;signed it&nbsp;without even asking her. She didn’t care who he&nbsp;was and she thought that what he&nbsp;did was really inappropriate. She tried to&nbsp;give the fan back to&nbsp;him, but Charles looked very embarrassed about it&nbsp;and didn’t take&nbsp;it. Mineko then threw it&nbsp;away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6f/583/a186e05423b9ce818651e1fa18.jpg><p><h2>Mineko became famous around the world thanks to&nbsp;the novel Memoirs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geisha, but she also sued the author because of&nbsp;this.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ae/880/c243075bf9b50e88e75a8a1971.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Memoirs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Geisha, 2005.</p><p>Mineko agreed to&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with the American writer, Arthur Golden, who wanted to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;book about geishas. She did it&nbsp;<a href=#>anonymously</a> but later realized that he&nbsp;lied to&nbsp;her several times. Mineko became a&nbsp;prototype of&nbsp;the main character of&nbsp;the book and it&nbsp;had words of&nbsp;gratitude addressed to&nbsp;her. When she read the book, she was horrified. In&nbsp;the story, geishas were presented like they were courtesans. Instead of&nbsp;explaining that they spread the traditions and culture of&nbsp;Japan and had nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with courtesans, Golden made up&nbsp;his own story to&nbsp;make the book more interesting. And he&nbsp;was good at&nbsp;it. The book was very popular and a&nbsp;film was even made that was based on&nbsp;it. The actress looked very similar to&nbsp;the prototype, but she was <a href=#>bound</a> by&nbsp;the wrong image that Golden created for her.</p><p>Mineko <a href=#>requested</a> that Golden rewrite the book and fix all the mistakes. He&nbsp;refused, so&nbsp;she sued him. The case was settled out of&nbsp;court and she got a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;money in&nbsp;damages.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;her book, Mineko describes the lives of&nbsp;geishas the way they really were.</h2></p><p>Mineko couldn’t let the <a href=#>book</a> be&nbsp;the only source of&nbsp;information about geishas.</p><p>That’s why Mineko decided to&nbsp;write her own book. She spoke honestly about her life and the traditions of&nbsp;geishas. This book became a&nbsp;bestseller too.</p><p><h2>Mineko’s private life and what she does now</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ce5/224/50ad0a5a3795f39bdfea90b96c.png><p>This is&nbsp;Mineko Iwasaki with her husband, Jinichiro Sato, and her daughter, Kosuke.</p><p>Mineko Iwasaki <a href=#>found</a> her happiness, even though she didn’t have much time for a&nbsp;personal life when she was working actively. She first fell in&nbsp;love when she was 21&nbsp;with Japanese actor Shintaro Katsu, who was almost 2&nbsp;times older than her. For a&nbsp;long time, Mineko refused his attention, but then she gave&nbsp;up. She met with him rarely and in&nbsp;secret. The actor promised to&nbsp;get divorced, but didn’t keep his word.</p><p>After she “retired” at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;29, she <a href=#>met</a> artist and restorer Jin’ichirō Satō. In&nbsp;1982, they got married and one year later, they had a&nbsp;daughter, Kosuke. After their marriage, Satō decided to&nbsp;take his wife’s last name. Today, they live in&nbsp;the suburbs of&nbsp;Kyoto. Mineko, just like her husband, is&nbsp;into art now: she does paintings and helps with restorations.</p><p>The family doesn’t give many <a href=#>interviews</a>, but if&nbsp;Jin’ichirō is&nbsp;asked about his marriage with Mineko, he&nbsp;always says, “I’m very lucky.”</p><p>Are you interested in&nbsp;Mineko Iwasaki’s story?
