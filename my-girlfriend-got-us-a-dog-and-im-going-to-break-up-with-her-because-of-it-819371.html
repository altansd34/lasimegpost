The decision to get a <a href=# title=dog data-link=tag>dog</a> revealed an ugly truth behind one man's <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>.</p><p><h2>He explained what happened</h2></p><p>Hello, I'm 25M, and my girlfriend is 23F. We've been together for over a year, and we generally have a great relationship. She's funny and kind. However,</p><p>Yesterday, when I got home, there was a Golden Retriever in our house. When I asked my girlfriend whose dog it was, she smiled and said, "Ours." I wasn't sure if she was joking or being serious, so I kept asking whose dog it was. She kept smiling and saying, "Ours," and then proceeded to say the dog's name (I don't remember what she said her name was since a lot was going through my mind). She even told the dog to say "Hi Dad."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/886/177/f81c9857818cbd0308b30c08d2.jpg><p>I told her that she couldn't be serious right now, and she replied, "Why?" with a big smile. I didn't say anything else and just left the house and went to a hotel.</p><p>At the beginning of our relationship, I had told her that I don't like dogs and can't be in the same room with one. Even when I see one in public, I put a good distance between me and the person walking the dog. I told her if she ever wanted a pet, she would have to get a cat or something else that is not a dog.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/166/ded/a81f5e5016bd5a2b464e4057f4.jpg><p>While at the hotel, my girlfriend called me a couple of times, but I didn't answer. Then she texted me, saying that I was overreacting and that my fear of dogs was ridiculous. She said I should at least give it a try and live with a dog for a while, and that she and the dog would help me overcome my fear. But I never asked to overcome it, and honestly, it never bothered me as long as there were no dogs in my house. I never got bothered by one in public because I always put a good distance between me and the dogs. I have never even petted a dog before and never will.</p><p>I ignored her messages and just went to sleep, as I wanted to decide what to do when my head was clearer. I don't want to be the guy who says it's either me or the dog. She clearly likes dogs, and I don't, so I was thinking of just breaking up with her, even though she has been amazing throughout the year. Am I wrong for wanting to break up with her over this?</p><p><h2>People stood on his side.</h2></p><ul><li>"I'm a dog lover, but if my husband said that he was terrified of dogs I wouldn't bring one home. It's not even about the dog at this point, it's the fact that she completely disregarded your feelings/boundaries and expects you to suck it up." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Visual-Lobster6625 / Reddit</a></li><li>"She chose the dog. The easiest way to break it off with you. Sorry dude." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Investigator516 / Reddit</a></li><li>"Even if you love dogs, she needed to discuss this with you before getting one." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ProtozoaPatriot / Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb3/5e1/51ea945347a5f99e93cc9261da.jpg><ul><li>"Even if you didn't have a fear of dogs at all she had no right to make such a huge decision for your household without even talking to you about it? This adds a huge layer of responsibility to you both. And since she knew it was a hard limit for you and did it anyway, I don't see where she found the audacity. You're not making her choose between you and the dog, you're asking her to <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> your long-established boundary and fix the mistake she made." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mouskete3r / Reddit</a></li><li>"You let her know up front that a dog was a deal breaker. She chose to ignore you. If you break up it's on her, not you." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Bulky_Specialist9645 / Reddit</a></li><li>"She's trying to bulldoze a hard boundary of yours and this sets a disturbing precedent if you accept it." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>JosKarith / Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/182/5e5/b7ffd85e8bbaea20e62d9f7a2c.jpg><ul><li>"She is blatantly ignoring your fear, telling you to get over it when youâ€™re not ready!! This is likely the first of soon-to-be many boundary-breaking moments in your relationship. Leave now!" <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Safe_Honeydew2763 / Reddit</a></li><li>"It's like she was TRYING to sabotage this relationship. Which does happen." <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>DinosaurInAPartyHat / Reddit</a></li><li>"She blatantly disregarded your concerns. She KNEW how you felt and STILL did this. She is selfish, manipulative and arrogant.
