It&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that flies originated in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Asia data-link=tag>Asia</a>, but these days they live everywhere people live, only excluding Antarctica, and&nbsp;— maybe&nbsp;— a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;islands. Flies have <a href=# title=traveled data-link=tag>traveled</a> the oceans following humans, but they never go&nbsp;anywhere alone. In&nbsp;the wilderness and deserts, where humans are absent, you won’t find any flies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/900/a40/bdc4935a448e88beff7b4483bc.jpeg><p>We&nbsp;know them well, but we&nbsp;all have that unanswered question about flies: why do&nbsp;flies rub their limbs? Turns out, they just clean them, it’s this simple. A&nbsp;fly has hair all over its body. The hairs on&nbsp;the limbs serve as&nbsp;detectors for flying, finding <a href=# title=food data-link=tag>food</a>, and doing whatever else the fly business&nbsp;is, they have to&nbsp;keep the limbs clear at&nbsp;all times. So, they just rub them every time they get a&nbsp;chance.</p><p>Their limbs are sensitive, and they serve more than one purpose. Apparently, the limbs have taste receptors, so&nbsp;the flies can taste with their feet. They can land on&nbsp;their potential meal and wander around&nbsp;it, giving it&nbsp;a&nbsp;good taste before consuming&nbsp;it.</p><p>Flies can’t chew, so&nbsp;they are on&nbsp;an&nbsp;all-liquid diet and drink their food. If&nbsp;the food they have picked as&nbsp;the next meal is&nbsp;solid, they have a&nbsp;special ritual to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;edible. A&nbsp;fly regurgitates digestive juices on&nbsp;their soon-to-be food, and those juices break it&nbsp;into the smallest pieces that can be&nbsp;drunk. Also, spitting out those juices frees up&nbsp;space in&nbsp;their stomachs for new food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/ae6/50d/5afac15464abf2d6ef54c6aa6f.jpeg><p>Quite often, flies sit on&nbsp;our food. They can appear harmless, but it’s not exactly true. First, remember that they spill out those juices onto your food, which is&nbsp;already gross enough. But there’s more. You have to&nbsp;keep in&nbsp;mind that flies land everywhere, and it’s not always flowers, but all the gross stuff as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And flies especially like that said gross stuff, like rotting foods, dumpsters, and even worse. So, their limbs collect all the gems and microbes from those places. When a&nbsp;fly lands on&nbsp;your food, it&nbsp;transfers those gems to&nbsp;your meal. Some of&nbsp;the microbes they transfer can even cause diseases, like cholera and typhoid.</p><p>There was even an&nbsp;experiment once made to&nbsp;demonstrate how it&nbsp;works. There were two bowls: one contained a&nbsp;red powder of&nbsp;some kind of&nbsp;spice, and the other bowl had white rice in&nbsp;it. Flies were let&nbsp;in, and they would migrate from the spice bowl to&nbsp;the rice bowl and back. Soon enough, rice got covered with red spice. Now replace harmless spice with something grosser, and rice with your dinner.</p><p>So, you should always cover your food to&nbsp;make sure some fly doesn’t take a&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;it&nbsp;and step and spit all over&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you are eating, make sure you swap them away. But don’t worry if&nbsp;some annoying fly manages to&nbsp;sit on&nbsp;your sandwich for a&nbsp;second before you kick it&nbsp;out. No&nbsp;need to&nbsp;throw the sandwich out, if&nbsp;you acted fast, then you’re safe. Also, experts say that an&nbsp;average healthy human has a&nbsp;strong enough <a href=# title="immune system" data-link=tag>immune system</a> to&nbsp;repel parasites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/349/4f3/f0701b5b48bba4a689253e801a.jpeg><p>Even though flies are gross and annoying, bugging around and tickling you with their limbs, they do&nbsp;serve some good. They are responsible for pollinating flowers: they collect nectar from them, which gets stuck to&nbsp;the hair on&nbsp;their bodies, and then they pollinate the next flower when landing on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, if&nbsp;flies didn’t exist, our planet would be&nbsp;even dirtier&nbsp;— flies recycle some of&nbsp;the human waste. Flies are also an&nbsp;important part of&nbsp;the ecosystem since they’re food for birds, spiders, lizards, frogs, and many more. Without flies, they’d all go&nbsp;extinct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/36c/ae1/e999c2511d90f82cd0b45bac54.jpeg><p>Apart from flies having the superpower of&nbsp;tasting with their feet, there are other interesting facts about them too. They can walk on&nbsp;both horizontal and vertical surfaces, and even upside down. They can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;because each one of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fly’s feet has two pads with tiny hair, and those hairs produce a&nbsp;glue-like substance that allows flies to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;excellent grip.</p><p>Flies have unique eyes, which have a&nbsp;large complex of&nbsp;3,000 to&nbsp;6,000 simpler eyes within each of&nbsp;the two compound eyes. A&nbsp;fly’s eyes don’t move, but its vision is&nbsp;nearly 360&nbsp;degrees. They can see behind their back. So, wherever you are, a&nbsp;fly definitely sees you and every other danger with one or&nbsp;a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;their thousands of&nbsp;monitors. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the two compound eyes, flies also have three simple eyes located on&nbsp;their foreheads, which serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;compass and allow a&nbsp;fly to&nbsp;navigate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f4d/143/bba8505de8b3da43308d37a4d4.jpeg><p>They also have an&nbsp;amazing reaction time. Ever wondered why is&nbsp;it&nbsp;so&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;swat a&nbsp;fly? Well, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;fly, we’re sloths. That’s because they see things in&nbsp;slow motion, compared to&nbsp;us. Species have different perceptions of&nbsp;speed.</p><p>The speed we&nbsp;see will be&nbsp;twice faster for a&nbsp;turtle. And it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;four times slower for a&nbsp;fly. Turn a&nbsp;video on&nbsp;0.25x speed and imagine someone approaching you with this speed. Well, that’s how a&nbsp;fly sees you. So&nbsp;yes, it&nbsp;has enough time to&nbsp;escape.</p><p>A&nbsp;fly has just one set of&nbsp;<a href=# title=wings data-link=tag>wings</a>. But in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the pair of&nbsp;wings, they also have so-called halters, which allow them to&nbsp;take off fast. Millions of&nbsp;years ago, halters were serving as&nbsp;a&nbsp;second pair of&nbsp;wings. Now they help to&nbsp;take off and also to&nbsp;balance in&nbsp;the air. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;fly loses one of&nbsp;the halters, it’ll start flying in&nbsp;circles. And if&nbsp;both of&nbsp;them go&nbsp;missing, it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fly anymore at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Also, even though their wings beat up&nbsp;to&nbsp;1,000 times per minute, they are very slow fliers, only reaching the speed of&nbsp;4.5 miles per hour. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;fly lives in&nbsp;an&nbsp;urban area, with enough people and garbage around, it&nbsp;doesn’t fly far away from the place of&nbsp;residence, only having a&nbsp;territory of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit over 3,200&nbsp;feet. Rural flies are far more explorative, and they can fly away up&nbsp;to&nbsp;7&nbsp;miles at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/4e0/83b/d2aaf75b69b32071c6802e0469.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;fly doesn’t live long: its lifetime is&nbsp;just around 30&nbsp;days. But during this time, they lay from 500 to&nbsp;800 eggs each, on&nbsp;average. But it’s not 1,000&nbsp;at once&nbsp;— it’s several goes throughout their life, with 75&nbsp;to&nbsp;100 eggs at&nbsp;once. The eggs hatch within 24&nbsp;hours, and it&nbsp;takes a&nbsp;week in&nbsp;total for an&nbsp;egg to&nbsp;turn into a&nbsp;grown fly, and then the cycle continues. In&nbsp;colder climates, this process can take twice as&nbsp;long.</p><p>A&nbsp;timber fly is&nbsp;the biggest fly species, which lives in&nbsp;Central and South America. They can grow up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3.15&nbsp;inches. Also, flies have “beds”, or&nbsp;more like their favorite spot to&nbsp;stay and sleep. They find a&nbsp;comfy place&nbsp;— somewhere close to&nbsp;the source of&nbsp;food&nbsp;— and they come there to&nbsp;rest at&nbsp;night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/023/204/2c9567506ea7238c43404feb5f.jpeg><p>If&nbsp;you ever had your house flooded with flies, here are a&nbsp;few tips for you to&nbsp;reduce their population. First, it’s important to&nbsp;understand what they are attracted&nbsp;to. They are attracted to&nbsp;other flies, and even to&nbsp;the smell of&nbsp;flies living there. And flies have an&nbsp;amazing sense of&nbsp;smell. So, if&nbsp;you hosted even one fly, expect to&nbsp;get more guests. If&nbsp;you have any traces of&nbsp;flies, like fly specks, they will find you too. Make sure to&nbsp;wash your walls and surfaces.</p><p>Next, flies love garbage and rotting produce. They lay eggs in&nbsp;rotten food and meat. So, make sure to&nbsp;keep your food in&nbsp;the fridge, cover&nbsp;it, and keep the trash in&nbsp;tightly sealed containers. And, of&nbsp;course, take out the trash regularly.</p><p>Flies have a&nbsp;sweet tooth (or&nbsp;more like sweet foot, since they taste with their feet), and they love syrup and other sugary liquids. They are also fond of&nbsp;soda and vinegar. So, make sure to&nbsp;keep those stored, and always wipe after yourself if&nbsp;you spill something.</p><p>Lastly, they like to&nbsp;hide and live in&nbsp;dirty and leaky drains&nbsp;— they eat the bacteria from there. So, always clear your drains and repair any leaks right away. Also, it’ll help to&nbsp;seal all the cracks in&nbsp;your floor, ceiling, and walls, if&nbsp;you have any&nbsp;— that’s one of&nbsp;their ways to&nbsp;get into the house.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmnaWhlah6s7HApaOyZZSkeri0xKdkraCVrnqtrc2dZKimXZu8sLCMcWhsbmdsfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-subjects-are-taught-in-schools-from-all-over-the-world-619460.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Subjects Are Taught in Schools From All Over the World">&larr;
