This answers the question of Dj Akademiks age for those who were wondering. Being a very private person only so much is known about him. He moved to the United States in 2001 and attended high school as a teenager in New Jersey. He was a shy student in high school making it hard for him to connect with the New Jersey culture. This led him to hang out with his Jamaican friends or stayed on his own. When out of school, he listened to rap music, leading him to falling in love with this specific genre. In the end, he became a rapper.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/718bd41c147144ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Andy Bassich from the show Life Below Zero?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Tyler Hoechlin: bio, age, height, ethnicity, girlfriend, is he gay?</p><h3>Academic and career</h3><p class=align-left>He went on to graduate from high school, and attend Rutgers University in New Jersey where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Biomathematics.
